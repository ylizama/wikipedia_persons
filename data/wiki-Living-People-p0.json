Two months later, the US rendered Aamer to the Guant\u00e1namo camp; he was held there without trial or charge. Aamer had been a legal resident in Britain for years before his imprisonment; the UK government repeatedly demanded his release, and many people there called for him to be released.According to documents published in the Guantanamo Bay files leak, the US military Joint Task Force Guantanamo believed that Aamer had led a unit of fighters in Afghanistan, including the Battle of Tora Bora, while his family was paid a stipend by Osama bin Laden. The file asserts past associations with Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui. Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity and his lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said the leaked documents would not stand up in court. He claimed that part of the evidence came from an unreliable witness and that confessions Aamer made had been obtained through torture. Aamer's father-in-law, Saaed Ahmed Siddique, said: \"All of these claims have no basis. If any of this was true he would be in a court now.\" The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer.Aamer has never been charged with any wrongdoing, was never on trial, and his lawyer says he is \"totally innocent.\" He was approved for transfer to Saudi Arabia by the Bush administration in 2007 and the Obama administration in 2009. He has been described as a \"charismatic leader\" who spoke up and fought for the rights of fellow prisoners. Aamer alleges that he has been subject to torture while in detention.Aamer has suffered decline in his mental and physical health over the years, as he participated in hunger strikes to protest his detention conditions, and was held in solitary confinement for much of the time. He claims to have lost 40 per cent of his body weight in captivity. After a visit in November 2011, his lawyer said, \"I do not think it is stretching matters to say that he is gradually dying in Guantanamo Bay.\" In 2015, despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied a request for an independent medical examination.In February 2015, 3 pupils from Kenilworth School, Warwickshire, Alex Brown, Thomas Edwards and Gareth Evans sent a letter requesting the release of Aamer to Jeremy Wright MP, which many believe was the start of helping Aamer being released and returned to the UK.\nAamer, the last British resident to be held at Guantanamo Bay, was released to the United Kingdom on 30 October 2015.\n\n\n== Family and personal life ==\nAamer was born on 21 December 1966 and grew up in Medina in Saudi Arabia. He left the country at the age of 17. He lived and traveled in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Aamer lived and studied in Georgia and Maryland in 1989 and 1990. During the Gulf War, he worked as a translator for the U.S. Army.He moved to the United Kingdom in 1996 where he met Zin Siddique, a British woman; they married in 1997 and he established legal residency in Britain. They have four British children, the youngest of whom Aamer had never met, due to his having been born after Aamer's imprisonment. Aamer had indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and was applying for British citizenship.Aamer worked as an Arabic translator for London law firms. Some of the solicitors he worked for dealt with immigration cases. In his spare time, Aamer helped refugees find accommodation and offered them advice on their struggles with the Home Office.In 2012, Aamer's family lived in Battersea, South London. His wife Zin Aamer suffered from depression and mental episodes after his arrest. Saeed Siddique, Aamer's father-in-law, said in 2011, \"When he was captured, Shaker offered to let my daughter divorce him, but she said, 'No, I will wait for you.' She is still waiting.\"\n\n\n== Capture and allegations ==\n\nAamer took his family to Afghanistan in 2001, where he was working for an Islamic charity when the U.S. invaded the country later that year. The Northern Alliance took him into custody in Jalalabad in December 2001, and passed him to the Americans. The US routinely paid ransom for Arabs handed over to them. They interrogated Aamer at Bagram Theater Internment Facility and transported him to Guantanamo on 14 February 2002.\nAccording to Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessments from 1 November 2007, the US military believed that Aamer was a \"recruiter, financier, and facilitator\" for al-Qaeda, based partly on evidence given by the informant Yasim Muhammed Basardah, a fellow detainee. The leaked documents alleged that Aamer had confessed to interrogators that he was in Tora Bora with Osama bin Laden at the time of the US bombing. The documents further note that the Saudi intelligence Mabahith identified Aamer \"as a high priority for the government of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his law enforcement value to them.\"In 2010, the Guantanamo Review Task Force released their report of the detainee assessments. In many instances, the Task Force largely agreed with prior threat assessments of the detainees and sometimes found additional information that further substantiated such assessments. In other instances, the Task Force found prior assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability. Conversely, in a few cases, the Task Force discovered reliable information indicating that a detainee posed a greater threat in some respects than prior assessments suggested.Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity and his attorney, Clive Stafford Smith of Reprieve, said the evidence against his client \"would not stand up in court.\" He pointed out that part of the evidence comes from Yasim Muhammed Basardah, whom American judges found to be \"utterly incredible\" and who was tortured and \"promised all sorts of things.\"The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer, and he was cleared for transfer in 2007. The clearance was for transfer to Saudi Arabia only.\n\n\n== Aamer's allegations of being tortured in Bagram ==\nIn September 2009, Zachary Katznelson, a Reprieve lawyer, said that Aamer had told of suffering severe beatings at the Bagram facility. Aamer said that close to a dozen men had beaten him, including interrogators who represented themselves as officers of MI5, the United Kingdom's internal counter-terrorism agency. Following one severe beating, he recovered from being stunned to find that all the interrogators had left the room and put a pistol on the table. He did not determine if the pistol was loaded. He said it occurred to him that it had been left either so he could kill himself, or that, if he picked it up, he could be shot and killed on the excuse he was trying to shoot them.Aamer says that the \"MI5\" interrogators told him he had two choices: (1) agree to spy on suspected jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody. He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his head against the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room.\nOther former detainees have alleged similar mistreatment by MI5 and MI6 agents, including torture. Seven detainees filed suit against the British government over their mistreatment and torture. In November 2010, the British government settled the suit, paying the detainees millions of pounds in compensation. Aamer is also on the compensation list and part of the deal, but details are not known as most of the deal is still secret.\n\n\n== Guantanamo ==\nAamer has been described as an unofficial spokesman for the detainees at Guantanamo. He has spoken up for the welfare of prisoners, negotiating with camp commanders and organizing protests against cruel treatment. He organized and participated in a hunger strike in 2005 in which he lost half of his weight. He demanded the prisoners be treated according to the Geneva Convention, allowing the detainees to form a grievance committee. In negotiations, the camp administration promised a healthier diet for the prisoners after he agreed to end the hunger strike. His lawyer Stafford Smith said the grievance committee was formed, but that the camp authorities disbanded it after a few days. American spokesmen Major Jeffrey Weir denied that the Americans had ever agreed to any conditions resulting from the hunger strike.\nIn September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. They argued extended periods of isolation were detrimental to his mental and physical health.Aamer continued to take part in additional hunger strikes and was held in solitary confinement for most of the time. His lawyers described his solitary confinement as \"cruel\" and said his health was affected to a point where they feared for his life. In 2011 Stafford Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve, said Aamer is \"falling apart at the seams.\"\n\nOn 18 September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. The motion alleges that Aamer had been held in solitary confinement for 360 days at the time of filing, and was tortured by beatings, exposure to temperature extremes, and sleep deprivation, which together caused him to suffer to the point of becoming mentally unbalanced. The next day Katznelson filed a motion to enforce the Geneva Conventions on his behalf.After President Barack Obama was elected, in 2009 he convened a six-agency task force to review the status of detainees at Guantanamo. It \"unanimously recommended\" transfer of Aamer. Security officials wanted to send him to Saudi Arabia, his country of citizenship, but his attorneys argued for him to be transferred to Great Britain, where he had been resident and had family.In September 2011, Aamer's lawyer Brent Mickum, who saw him in Guant\u00e1namo, alleges that Aamer was repeatedly beaten before their meetings. He said that Aamer's mental and physical health is deteriorating. \"It felt like he has given up: that's what 10 years, mostly in solitary confinement will do to a person,\" he said.Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian prisoner who formerly occupied a cell one door down from Aamer, has said since his release that he knows why Aamer is still in the prison camps.\nI would say the Americans are trying to keep him as silent as they could. It's not that he has anything. What happened in 2005 and 2006 is something that the Americans don't want the world to know \u2013 hunger strikes, and all the events that took place, until the three brothers who died ... insider information of all the events, probably. Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released.\nClive Stafford Smith, his lawyer and director of human rights organisation Reprieve, came to a similar conclusion. He said:\nI have known Shaker for some time, because he is so eloquent and outspoken about the injustices of Guantanamo he is very definitely viewed as a threat by the US. Not in the sense of being an extremist but in the sense of being someone who can rather eloquently criticise the nightmare that happened there.\nOmar Deghayes, a former Guantanamo Detainee who knew Aamer, said of him,\n\nHe was always forward, he would translate for people, he'd fight for them, and if he had any problems in the block he'd shout at the guards... until he would get you your rights. And that's why he's still in prison... because he's very outspoken, a very intelligent person, somebody who would fight for somebody else's rights.\n\n\n=== At Camp \"No\" on June 2006 ===\n\nIn an article published in 2010, Aamer said that he was beaten for hours and subjected to interrogation methods that included asphyxiation on 9 June 2006, the same day that three fellow prisoners died in Guantanamo. The United States claimed these deaths were suicides.Describing his treatment, Aamer said that he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs, while MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They bent his nose repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.\n\nThe law professor Scott Horton published an award-winning article on the 2006 deaths in Harper's Magazine in 2010, suggesting that these were cases of homicide caused by extended torture, rather than suicide. He said that Aamer had been brought to \"Camp No,\" a secret interrogation black site outside the camp, with the three men who died on the day of the event. Horton described Aamer's account of having his airways cut off as \"alarming\" and wrote, \"This is the same technique that appears to have been used on the three deceased prisoners.\" Colonel Michael Bumgarner, the commander of the camps during the incident and identified in Horton's article as having been present during the interrogations, denied Horton's claims.Horton wrote that Aamer's repatriation was being delayed so that he could not testify about his alleged torture in Bagram or the events of 9 June 2006. He wrote: \"American authorities may be concerned that Aamer, if released, could provide evidence against them in criminal investigations.\"\n\n\n=== 2013 hunger strike and detention condition ===\nIn 2013, Aamer told his attorneys that he was among the growing group of active hunger strikers. He said he had been refusing meals since 15 February and had lost 32 pounds. In previous hunger strikes guards force-fed him with tubes down his nose. His lawyer said Aamer spent 22 hours a day alone in his cell. Aamer was not permitted visitors except his attorneys. Aamer was among a group of detainees who filed a court challenge to the authorities' practice of force feeding those on hunger strikes. A United States appellate court ruled in 2014 \"that the judiciary could oversee conditions of confinement at the prison.\"\n\n\n=== 2014 motion for release ===\nIn 2014, his lawyers filed a motion on Aamer's behalf seeking his release on the grounds that his health is \"gravely diminished\". They argued that his various health problems could not be treated in Guantanamo and \"even if he receives the intensive medical and therapeutic treatment his condition requires, Mr Aamer will take many years, if not a lifetime, to achieve any significant recovery\". His lawyers argued that both the Geneva Convention and Army Regulation 190-8, require the repatriation of chronically ill prisoners.  In 2015 despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied attorneys' request for an independent medical examination.\n\n\n== UK release negotiations ==\nThe United Kingdom government initially refused to intervene on the behalf of Guant\u00e1namo detainees who were legal British residents but were not British citizens.  In August 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband requested the release of Aamer and four other men, based on their having been granted refugee status, or similar leave, to remain in Britain as residents prior to their capture by US forces. With the repatriation of Binyam Mohammed in February 2009, all British citizens and residents other than Aamer had been released.The UK government officials repeatedly raised Aamer's case with the Americans.  On a visit to the United States on 13 March 2009, when asked about Guant\u00e1namo captives, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said that the US administration has said they do not want to return Aamer to the UK. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, raised Aamer's case again with Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, in November 2010, followed by meetings with other US officials.  At the time, the US government had reached settlement with former detainees as a resolution for damages due to the use of torture in interrogation.In September 2011, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that negotiations were ongoing and confidential. Supporters of Aamer criticized the UK government for not doing enough on his behalf; they urged the government to step up their efforts. In January 2012, The Independent revealed that the British government has spent \u00a3274,345 fighting in court including preventing Aamer's lawyers gaining access to evidence which might have proved his innocence. The newspaper reported that Aamer had several serious medical complaints from years of \"inhumane\" detention conditions, and that the UK gave false hope to his family.\n\n\n== Calls for his release ==\nIn January 2010, his 12-year-old daughter Johina wrote a letter to Gordon Brown asking for her father's release.\nAugust, 2010, protesters disrupted a meeting that discussed plans to create a US Embassy near Battersea, the home of Aamer and his family.\nOn 11 December 2010, hundreds took to the streets in London near the US embassy to demand Aamer's release.\nIn February 2011, Amnesty International called Aamer's incarceration a \"mockery of justice\" and denounced the \"cruel limbo\" he was held in. At the same time The Guardian reported that people had sent 12000 emails to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and UK MPs in support of Aamer.\nIn May 2011, students of University of St Andrews protested for the release of Aamer.\nIn early 2012, as Aamer neared ten years' imprisonment in Guant\u00e1namo, campaigners stepped up efforts for his release. Among them, Jane Ellison, Tory MP for Battersea, wrote to President Barack Obama to urge Aamer's release.\nFebruary 2012, marking the 10th anniversary of Aamer's detention, a series of protests took place in England while detainees conducted a hunger strike in Guantanamo.\nIn December 2012, the comedian Frankie Boyle donated \u00a350,000 to Aamer's legal fund for suits against MI6.\nBy April 2013, 117,384 British citizens or UK residents had signed an online petition to pressure the UK Government for Aamer's release.\nIn July 2013, Clive Stafford-Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve; Frankie Boyle, Scottish comedian; and actress Julie Christie went on a sequential hunger strike in support of Shaker Aamer and his release.\nIn March 2015 British lawmaker John McDonnell said, \"The case of Shaker Aamer is one of the worst cases of a miscarriage of justice in the last three decades at least ... He has endured harsh, and brutal and inhuman treatment,\" in a debate in which members of all major political parties called for Aamer's release.\nOn 4 July 2015 (US Independence Day), 80 prominent Britons including six former cabinet ministers, leading writers, actors, directors, and musicians urged Obama to free Aamer.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn 30 October 2015, Aamer was flown from Cuba, stepping on British soil at 13.00 GMT. In a later interview he discussed his detention and family life. He also called upon jihadis to \"get the hell out\" of Britain, stating that civilian killings were \"not allowed\" in Islam, and went on to say that \"you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people\" in apparent reference to the murder of Lee Rigby.\n\n\n== Representation in other media ==\nIn her album In The Current Climate (2011), singer-songwriter Sarah Gillespie had an imaginary first-person song of Aamer, entitled \"How The West was Won\". Gillespie dedicated the track to Aamer in the CD booklet.\nIn August 2013 the singer PJ Harvey released the song \"Shaker Aamer,\" describing Aamer's plight being force-fed during a month-long hunger strike.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPoems From Guant\u00e1namo mentions \"They Fight for Peace\" written by Shaker Aamer\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAamer, \"My fight for justice in Guant\u00e1namo\", dictated by Aamer to his lawyer on 10 June 2013, The Guardian, 14 June 2013\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShaker Aamer \u2013 biography\nShaker Aamer: UK man's nine years at Guantanamo has made a 'mockery' of Justice \u2013 Amnesty International\nSave Shaker Aamer at SSAC\nShaker Aamer's detainee assessment via New York Times\nReport on Aamer's health by independent psychiatrist, Dr. Emily A.

He was State Secretary for three non-consecutive terms between 1973 and 1993, and served as Director of the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway from 1993 to 2011.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nBorn in Oslo, Aamo grew up in Mandal. He became involved in politics at an early age, and was appointed chairman of the local Workers' Youth League chapter in 1962. He then moved back to the capital to enroll at the University of Oslo. He became chairman of the Workers' Youth League chapter there. Situated on the left wing of the organization, he became a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War as well as the Norwegian North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership, much to the dismay of party secretary Haakon Lie. However, Aamo found support from fellow economist Per Kleppe, at that time a deputy member of the party central committee and head of the think tank Arbeiderbevegelsens utredningskontor.Aamo graduated with the degree cand.oecon. in economics in 1970, and from 1971 to 1972 he worked as personal secretary (today known as political adviser) in the Ministry of Local Government and Labour. He was then promoted to State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance from 1973 to 1979, serving under Per Kleppe who had become Minister of Finance.He was then head of the department of economics in the European Free Trade Association from 1979 to 1981, and director of the Regional Development Fund from 1981 to 1986. He then returned as State Secretary from 1986 to 1989 under Minister of Finance Gunnar Berge in Brundtland's Second Cabinet. He lost his job when Brundtland's Second Cabinet fell in 1989, and briefly returned to Regional Development Fund. In 1990 as the short-lived Syse's Cabinet fell and Brundtland's Third Cabinet assumed office, Aamo was appointed State Secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister.\n\n\n=== Financial Supervisory Authority ===\nIn 1993 he was appointed Director of the Financial Supervisory Authority, succeeding Svein Aasmundstad. This decision was criticized by the political opposition. Aamo belonged to the same political party as Minister of Finance Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen and the rest of Brundtland's Third Cabinet. Since Aamo came directly from a government position, that of state secretary, parliament member Lars Gunnar Lie cited concern about a perceived lack of distance between the third cabinet Brundtland and the Financial Supervisory Authority. This would put the independence of the latter at odds, he claimed. However, most of the criticism was directed at Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen, who at that time was under scrutiny for his involvement with private corporation UNI Storebrand. The Financial Supervisory Authority would have a role in this scrutiny, and several people, including parliament member Kristin Halvorsen, asked for the appointment of Johnsen's party fellow be postponed until after the case was closed. Parliament member Carl I. Hagen called for Johnsen to resign. On the other hand, conservative newspaper Aftenposten defended the decision in an op-ed the next day, citing Aamo's strong qualifications for the job. The criticism did not hinder the appointment of Aamo, and Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen remained in his seat.\nAamo applied for the position as Governor of the Central Bank of Norway in 1999, but Svein Gjedrem was appointed.During the economic crisis of 2008, Aamo stated that banks are safer in Norway than in any other country. The matters are complicated by Norway's close relations to Iceland, whose national crisis had consequences for Norwegian customers in the banks Glitnir and Kaupthing. Aamo is himself a board member of the Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAamo is married to Eldrid Nordb\u00f8, former government minister.\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_Skogstad_Aamo"}, {"title": "Aleksander Aamodt Kilde", "Content": "Aleksander Aamodt Kilde (born 21 September 1992) is a Norwegian World Cup alpine ski racer.

He is one of the most successful alpine ski racers from Norway.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Oslo, Aamodt is the only alpine skier to win 8 Olympic medals, and has won 5 World Championship gold medals as well as 21 individual World Cup events. Described as an all-round alpine skier, Aamodt participated in all alpine skiing disciplines in the World Cup and World Championships, and is one of only five male alpine skiers to have won a World Cup race in all five disciplines.\nAamodt's combined career total of twenty World Championship and Olympic medals is an all-time best. He is the second-youngest male alpine skier to win an Olympic gold medal (age 20 in 1992; Toni Sailer was two months younger in 1956). Until 2014, he was also the oldest alpine skier to win an Olympic gold medal. For almost six years, Aamodt led the all-time Marathon World Cup ranking, with a total of 13,252 points earned from 1989 to 2006 \u2013 until 14 March 2012, when Austrian Benjamin Raich overtook him with a fifth place in the downhill at the 2012 World Cup final in Schladming to total 13,281 points, earned from 1998.\nAnother all-time best is his 231 World Cup top-ten results, 9 ahead of Benjamin Raich.\nBy winning the super-G race at the 2006 Olympics, Aamodt became the first male alpine skier to win four gold medals in the Olympics.

Since the 1950s, Aamot has been a pioneer within the field of electronic painting, exploring the emerging technology as it combines with the traditional arts of painting, music, film, theatre, and ballet. Aamot studied painting at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts (Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry and Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts), and film at Dramatiska Institutet in Stockholm. Aamot is known for his work as a painter, electronic painter, art photographer, graphic artist, film director, tonal-image composer and cultural author. Much of his work consists of creating electronic tonal images and thus his work contains elements of photography but is hard to pigeon hole. It is frequently a form of performance art with abstract photographic elements. Since 1966, Aamot's works have been displayed in Scandinavia, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia, Poland, United States and Japan. His work can be found in several important public collections. Aamot has been represented at several international film and art festivals throughout the world.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAamot was, from a very early age, taught after Bauhaus principles by his father Randulf Aamot, a master carpenter and wood carver. In 1952, he had his first solo exhibit of paintings at the Paus Knudsen Gallery in Bergen. In 1953, at the age of 18, while still attending the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Oslo, he was awarded a major public commission for the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo. From 1957 until 1960, he studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts with the painters Aage Storstein and Alexander Schultz, both of them firmly anchored in the effort to combine figuration and abstraction typical of the 1920s. He later studied Film at the Dramatic Institute in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Electronic art in television ==\nAamot's electronic tonal-image work \"Evolution\" (1966) with music by Arne Nordheim was shown on Norwegian television in 1967. \"Evolution\" represented a milestone of a new art form in which television for the first time was used as an independent picture-artistic means of expression. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Aamot created a series of works for television.\n\n\n== Video art and digital photopaintings ==\nAamot became a controversial artist in the 1960s and 1970s. From the latter half of the 1980s, he worked with computer paintings on canvas, digital photopaintings and graphic art. He has continued to make video and film art, often in collaboration with the painter and composer Bj\u00f8rg L\u00f8d\u00f8en and the photographer, dancer and choreographer Kristin Lodoen Linder.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\n\n== Tonal-image compositions for screen ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\"Evolution\" (1966)\n\"Relieff nr.2\" (1967\u201368)\n\"BSK\" (1968)\n\"Visual\" (1971)\n\"Progress\" (1977)\n\"Structures\" (1979)\n\"Medusa\" (1986)\n\"Puls\" (1986)\n\"Close cluster\" (N\u00e6rklang) (1987)\n\"Expulsion\" (1987)\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\"Relieff\" (1966\u201367)\n\"Kinetic Energy\" (1967\u201368)\n\"Vision\" (1969)\n\"Structures\" (1970)\n\"Actio\" (1980)\n\"Aurora Borealis\" (1991)\n\"Tide\" (2000)\n\"Energy\" (2003)\n\"U\" (2005)\n\"Ir\" (2006)\n\"Wirr\" (2008)\n\"Contra\" (2009)\n\"X\" (2010)\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRolf Aamot official website\nInterview, 1 November 2010. \"Rolf Aamot: One Of The World's Pioneers In Digital Art\"\nStore Norske Leksikon (Norwegian encyclopedia)\nBj\u00f8rg L\u00f8d\u00f8en official website\nKristin L\u00f8d\u00f8en official website\nArt at the Worker\u00b4s Place, Oslo, Norway\nStore norske leksikon (Norwegian encyclopedia), (Kunnskapsforlaget, Oslo, Norway).\nNorsk biografisk leksikon (Norwegian biography encyclopedia), 1999-2005 band 10, (Kunnskapsforlaget, Oslo, Norway).\nAllgemeines K\u00fcnstler-Lexikon, band 1, M\u00fcnchen and Leipzig: K.

He was imprisoned in 2012 for posting comments and images to Facebook that were judged to be \"disseminating information aimed at inciting religious hatred or hostility\" by the Muaro Sijunjung district court. The sentence sparked national debate and caused Amnesty International to designate him a prisoner of conscience.\n\n\n== Arrest and trial ==\nPrior to his arrest, Alexander was a civil servant in the Pulau Punjung subdistrict of West Sumatra province. Though he had been raised as a Muslim, Alexander raised doubts about God by age 11, and stopped participating in religious rituals in 2008. In January 2012, he posted to an atheist Facebook group he had joined, stating that God did not exist. His post asked, \"If God exists, why do bad things happen? ... There should only be good things if God is merciful.\" He declared heaven, hell, angels, and devils to be \"myths\". He also posted an article describing Mohammad as \"attracted to his daughter-in-law\".\nThe posts were seen by the Indonesian Council of Ulema, who reported him to the police for blasphemy. On 18 January, an angry mob attacked Alexander on his way to work, causing police to take him into protective custody. Two days later, he was charged with \"disseminating information aimed at inciting religious hatred or hostility\". The district police chief also stated that Alexander had lied on his application for his government job, claiming to be Muslim.\nOn 14 June, the Muaro Sijunjung district court found Alexander guilty of \"disseminating information aimed at inciting religious hatred or hostility\" and sentenced him to two and a half years' imprisonment and a fine of 100 million rupiah (US$10,600). During the sentencing, the presiding judge described Alexander's actions as having \"caused anxiety to the community and tarnished Islam\". \nOn 27 January 2014, Aan was released from prison.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nAlexander's arrest caused \"outrage\" among both domestic and international religious freedom activists, and several petitions were circulated calling for his release. Setara Institute director Hendardi described the requested sentence as \"excessive\", a demonstration of \"the arbitrariness of the law and law enforcement officials\", and a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Indonesia is a signatory. Amnesty International responded by designating Alexander a prisoner of conscience, describing the sentence as \"a serious setback for freedom of expression in Indonesia\". The organization called for Alexander's immediate release. Human Rights Watch stated that Alexander's sentence suggested \"a threat to Indonesia's religious minorities\" in light of recent attacks by extremists. The Asian Human Rights Commission also called for Alexander's release, stating that his actions did not \"pose a threat to public order\" and were covered by freedom of religion.Atheist Alliance International began a campaign on Alexander's behalf, stating that his case \"highlights the fundamental principles of freedom of expression and freedom of conscience and the discrimination faced by atheists, particularly in Islamic countries.\" An opinion column in The Jakarta Globe described the charges as \"a blight on Indonesia's democratic credentials\" and a threat to Indonesia's attractiveness to foreign investors.The Center for Inquiry, first supporting the petition of the Asian Human Rights Commission, organized a protest outside the Indonesian Embassy in Washington, DC on 18 June 2012, calling for Indonesian authorities to release and exonerate Aan. A second CFI-organized protest outside the Indonesian Consulate in New York City took place on July 6. CFI also sent a letter demanding for Aan's release to the Indonesia Embassy through its Office of Public Policy.The Islamic Society Forum, a coalition of far right Islamist groups, stated that the potential five-year sentence was not enough, and that Aan should be executed. The organization's secretary-general stated, \"What he has done cannot be tolerated... it is important to prevent this group from spreading atheism in this country.\" The atheist Facebook group which he founded saw a surge in membership, up to 2,000. However, most of these were against atheists and Aan; some postings included calls for atheists to be beheaded and calling them cowards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnti-atheism in Indonesia\nDiscrimination against atheists in Indonesia\nHuman rights in Indonesia\nReligion in Indonesia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Aan"}, {"title": "Uno Aan", "Content": "Uno Aan (born in 1936) is an Estonian local historian and local cultural, sport figure.

Aanes received both a Bachelors and Master's in Special Education from the University of Northern Colorado following spending two years in the Peace Corps. Her other career focus was in the physical disability field. She founded the community, Access Alaska, which allows people with physical disabilities to live independently.The majority of her career was devoted to her advocacy and activism for people with physical disabilities in Alaska, particularly mentally competent adults. Her activism contributed  to the development of the numerous Centers for Independent Living, serving the state of Alaska (both rural and downtown).She was inducted into the Alaska Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2012 for her work in helping disabled persons gain access to independent living in Alaska.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Peace Corps ===\nAanes' work with people with disabilities began in 1965 when she was stationed in Ethiopia as a Peace Corp Volunteers. In 1967, Aanes relocated her work to Turkey.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nUpon arriving back in the US, Aanes went to college at the University of Northern Colorado. After graduating from the University of Northern Colorado in 1969 with a Bachelor's in Special Education, Aanes went on to get her Master's in Special Education from the University of Northern Colorado, finishing in 1969.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Alaska ===\nAanes was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2012 for her work on Advocacy. Other inductees include Politician and Governor, Sarah Palin, and Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race Champion, Susan Butcher.\nIn 1971, she returned to Alaska where she began teaching students with physical disabilities in a classroom setting. Her role in the lives of the physically disabled evolved when she resigned from teaching and became actively involved in advocacy for the standards of living of the physically disabled. Her mission revolved around changing the then existing circumstances for  high school graduates with physical disability, who had limited opportunities and were housed in nursing homes with senior citizens with conditions like dementia. She then founded Access Alaska, the first independent living program where her work involved campaigning to ensure the disabled had equal access to resources like housing, transportation, restrooms and restaurants and also opportunities to actively participate in society through respectable jobs and vocational training.Aanes also championed efforts on the legislative front to grow support for the Independent Living movement by speaking at public hearings, soliciting financial support and highlighting the need for changing related laws. Her efforts were rewarded in 1980, with Access Alaska receiving a state grant to address issues including independent-living-skills training and amenities she would need to facilitate her work. The increasing impact of her work was exemplified in 1982 when 8 young disabled adults moved out of nursing homes into equipped and accessible apartments in Anchorage, downtown Alaska. Furthermore, she extended her efforts with the Independent Living Program to northwest Alaska, by founding Arctic Access in 1993.\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Aanes"}, {"title": "Fritz Aanes", "Content": "Fritz Aanes (born July 20, 1978) is a Greco-Roman wrestler from Narvik, Norway.\nAt the 2000 Summer Olympics he finished fourth in the 85 kg category.

However, he competed mostly in the Continental Cup.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Oslo, he grew up in the neighborhood Holmenkollen, and was introduced to ski jumping in kindergarten by a father who had seen him jump there. He joined the sports club Ready, training under the regional ski jumping umbrella team Kollenhopp.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAaraas made his debut in the Continental Cup, the second highest level of international ski jumping, with a fourteenth place in Seefeld on 1 January 2003. Around that time he was considered among the best junior ski jumpers in Norway, However, three days after Seefeld he only managed to finish 50th in Bischofshofen. He did not return to the Continental Cup until August the same year, and though his talent was lauded by coach Mika Kojonkoski, a series of mid-level results followed, never reaching the top ten except for a sixth place in Sapporo in January 2004. Nonetheless, he was included as a part of the national B team. In late 2004, he recorded a sixth place in Rovaniemi in December.  This was followed by seven results among the top ten before the end of the 2004\u201305 season. He also made his debut in the World Cup with a 26th place in Pragelato in February, and later recorded a 48th place in Lillehammer in March. He was considered for a spot in the Norwegian 2005 World Ski Championships squad, but was not actually picked.\nThe 2005\u201306 season was not successful, however, with Aaraas not placing among the top ten in the Continental Cup, and not featuring at all in the World Cup. He failed to reach the 2006 Winter Olympics, which had been a declared goal for many years. In December 2006, though, he reached new lengths as he finished among the top eleven in three out of four Continental Cup races in Rovaniemi. For this, he was drafted onto the Norwegian team to compete in the Four Hills Tournament around New Year. He only actually qualified for one of the four races, that of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but returned to the World Cup circuit for various events later that winter, including one ski flying event in Vikersundbakken.The 2007\u201308 season saw Aaraas perform consistently well. He finished among the top four on four occasions in the Continental Cup, with second places from Villach in September and Kranj in January as the best result. Following this result, he had a World Cup run where he finished around 20th-30th six times in a row, with a nineteenth place from Zakopane as the best result. The 2008\u201309 season saw Aaraas mainly competing in the Continental Cup. He recorded four second places and two third places. In the 2008\u201309 World Cup he competed in five races and managed one 29th place as the best, in March 2009 in Kuopio. He did not compete in the World Cup anymore. In the 2009\u201310 Continental Cup he came in the top ten twice, but in the 2010\u201311 Continental Cup he only participated in two races in December 2010 in Vikersund. In a test race in the new ski flying hill in Vikersund in February 2011, Aaraas improved his personal best from 190 to 219 metres.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Atlanta Braves.\n\n\n== Amateur career ==\nAardsma was born in Denver, Colorado, and attended Cherry Creek High School in Colorado, graduating in 2000. He subsequently attended Pennsylvania State University in his first year of college. He transferred to Rice University in 2001, where he remained for the rest of his college tenure. Playing for the Rice Owls baseball team, Aardsma set school single-season and career records in saves in 2003. In the 2003 College World Series, he earned two wins and a save as the Owls won their first national championship.\nIn 2002, while playing collegiate summer baseball for the Falmouth Commodores in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), Aardsma was named a league all-star, posting a 0.68 ERA with 45 strikeouts over 26.2 innings. In 2010, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== San Francisco Giants ===\nThe right-hander was drafted in the 1st round (22nd overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. He went to the San Jose Giants (Single-A), where he posted a 1.96 ERA while striking out 28 in about 18 innings. He made the major-league roster in 2004, skipping Double-A and Triple-A, and made his debut in the season's second game. In his major league debut, in front of friends and family at Minute Maid Park, he pitched two innings, allowing three hits and walking one, to earn his first MLB win. In his first six appearances, he had a 1.80 ERA; unfortunately his success did not last as his ERA ballooned to 6.75 after 11 appearances. After giving up two runs in one inning on April 20, he was sent down to Fresno, the Giants Triple-A team, the next day. He was called up six more times throughout the season.\nAardsma's route through professional baseball has been somewhat unusual, given that after making the leap from Single-A to the Giants, he was demoted to Triple-A and then subsequently started the 2005 season in Double-A with the Norwich Navigators.\n\n\n=== Chicago Cubs ===\nAlong with pitcher Jerome Williams, Aardsma was traded to the Chicago Cubs for veteran pitcher LaTroy Hawkins on May 28, 2005. He spent the season in the minor leagues before returning to the big leagues with the Cubs in 2006, posting a 3\u20130 record and 4.08 ERA in 45 relief appearances, finishing nine games. Aardsma was especially effective against left-handed hitters, holding them to a .190 (12-for-63) batting average against.\n\n\n=== Chicago White Sox ===\nAfter a solid 2006 season with the Cubs, Aardsma, along with minor leaguer Carlos V\u00e1squez, was sent across town to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for reliever Neal Cotts. Aardsma started the 2007 season strong. In April, he posted a 1.72 ERA while recording 23 strikeouts in only 15.2 innings pitched; he struck out at least one batter in each of his first 13 appearances of the season. On April 4, Aardsma matched a career high with five strikeouts against the Cleveland Indians. On April 11, as the White Sox visited the Oakland Athletics, he recorded his first American League win. In May, however, troubles mounted and Aardsma finished the month with a season ERA to that point of 4.73 and an ERA of 9.00 for the month.\nFollowing June 2, Aardsma was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte. He was recalled on June 19, but continued to struggle in his last appearances with the team.\n\n\n=== Boston Red Sox ===\nOn January 28, 2008, the Boston Red Sox acquired Aardsma from the White Sox for pitching prospects Willy Mota and Miguel Socolovich.He pitched in 47 games for the team that year, going 4\u20132 with a 5.55 ERA. He also spent two games in the minors, posting a 0.00 ERA for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox.\nAlphabetically, Aardsma appears first on the all-time list of Boston Red Sox players.\n\n\n=== Seattle Mariners ===\nLess than a year after joining the Red Sox, Aardsma was traded to the Seattle Mariners on January 20, 2009, for minor league pitcher Fabian Williamson. On April 10, he recorded the first save of his career, pitching 2 innings of relief against the Oakland Athletics.\nThe Mariners gave Aardsma a chance to close a game behind Brandon Morrow. Afterward, he became the team's official closer.\n\nAardsma was a projected pick for the All-Star Game, but failed to make both the starting and the reserve roster. He followed an outstanding 2009 season with an excellent 2010. Converting 31 of 35 save opportunities, he finished the year 19-for-20 in saves with a 1.80 ERA from June 13 to September 19.\nAfter having Tommy John surgery in July 2011, Aardsma was not offered arbitration by the Mariners and became a free agent after the season.\n\n\n=== New York Yankees ===\nOn February 22, 2012, Aardsma signed a contract with the New York Yankees worth one year and $500,000 with a club option for 2013. The General Manager was quoted as saying, \"The move could help us in 2012, but it has a lot more eyes toward 2013.\" Aardsma was activated from the disabled list on September 25, 2012 after Steve Pearce and Justin Thomas were designated for assignment. He pitched in just one game for the Yankees, on September 27, and allowed one run in one inning.\nOn October 29, the Yankees elected to exercise Aardsma's incentive-laden $500,000 club option for 2013. However, they designated him for assignment before the start of the 2013 season. When no other team claimed him off waivers, he was released.\n\n\n=== Miami Marlins/New York Mets ===\nDesiring the best opportunity for playing time, Aardsma signed with the Miami Marlins, and was assigned to their Class AAA team. He opted out of his contract on May 15, 2013 after pitching in ten games for the New Orleans Zephyrs.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, Aardsma signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. After pitching in eight games for the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, he was promoted to the Mets on June 8, 2013. He appeared in 43 games for the Mets with a 4.31 ERA and a 2\u20132 record.\n\n\n=== Cleveland Indians/St. Louis Cardinals ===\nAardsma signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians on January 23, 2014. He was released on March 21, 2014 after not making the team in spring training.Aardsma promptly signed another minor league deal, this time with the St. Louis Cardinals on March 26, 2014. He played in 35 games in the Cardinals farm system, mostly with the AAA Memphis Redbirds and was 4\u20131 with a 1.46 ERA and 11 saves.\n\n\n=== Los Angeles Dodgers ===\nAardsma signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 15, 2015, and was invited to spring training. He did not make the Dodgers opening day roster, and was instead assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. In 20 games with Oklahoma City, he had a 2.41 ERA and 18 saves. He opted out of his contract on June 4 and became a free agent.\n\n\n=== Atlanta Braves ===\nOn June 6, 2015, Aardsma signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. He was added to the Major League roster on June 9. He was designated for assignment on August 24 after compiling a 4.99 ERA in 33 games for the Braves. He was released on September 1 and never pitched again in the major leagues.\n\n\n=== Toronto Blue Jays ===\nOn February 5, 2016, Aardsma signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was assigned to minor league camp on March 25. On May 23, Aardsma opted out of his contract.\n\n\n=== Long Island Ducks ===\nOn April 3, 2017, Aardsma signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAardsma announced his retirement on February 5, 2018, and joined the Blue Jays front office as a coordinator of player development.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAardsma is of Dutch descent, with all of his great-great grandparents coming from the Netherlands. Because of this, he was slated to play for the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic, but was ruled ineligible and did not play. Of all baseball players in history, the surname 'Aardsma' ranks first alphabetically; his major league debut displaced Hall of Famer Hank Aaron. Aardsma's sister is American actress and beauty pageant contestant Amanda Aardsma.Aardsma and his wife Andrea have a son, born on June 26, 2010.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCareer statistics and player information from MLB, or ESPN, or Baseball Reference, or Fangraphs, or Baseball Reference (Minors), or Retrosheet\nDavid Aardsma on Twitter", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Aardsma"}, {"title": "Gerard J.

He has spoken and written on homosexuality,  parapsychology, near-death experience, pro-life and pro-family matters. He has more than 50 years of therapeutic experience with homosexuals. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nGerard J. M. van den Aardweg received his PhD in psychology from the University of Amsterdam with a dissertation published in 1967 under the title \"Homophilia, neurosis and compulsive self-pity\". It was the Netherlands' first dissertation on homosexuality. \nVan den Aardweg rejects the idea that homosexuality is a biologically innate trait. Instead, he calls homosexuality (an expression of) \"a disease of infantile self pity.\" Van den Aardweg believes that no one is born gay, that there are no gay children, and that \u201c[h]omosexuality is not equal to heterosexuality. Scientifically this is absolutely absurd.\u201d In 2011 Aardweg published an article in the peer-reviewed journal The Linacre Quarterly, stating that:\n\"The best-established facts in relation to homosexuality point to developmental-psychological, not genetic or physiological, causation. The efforts of the last few decades to find evidence to support a biological theory have made it more doubtful than ever that such evidence will be found. In contrast, many studies have shown that the most significant factor which correlates with homosexuality is \u201cgender nonconformity\u201d or same-sex peer isolation. Another factor closely associated with homosexuality is an imbalance in parent-child interaction, notably forms of over-influence of the opposite-sex parent in combination with a deficient relationship with the same-sex parent. The third well-established correlation is with inherent, rather than discrimination-produced, \u201cneuroticism\u201d or emotional instability/immaturity.\"\nHe has been a former member of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality\u2019s (NARTH) Scientific Advisory Committee.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nGerard J.

She was subsequently chosen as the second premier of Nunavut, under the territory's consensus government system, on November 14, 2008. Aariak was the fifth woman to serve as a premier in Canada.\nIn January 2021, Aariak became the sixth commissioner of Nunavut.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to her election as an MLA, Aariak was the first Languages Commissioner for Nunavut. Originally appointed to a four-year term beginning in 1999, her term was later extended for another year until December 2004.In her capacity as Languages Commissioner, she was asked to choose an Inuktitut language word for the Internet; she settled on ikiaqqivik (IPA: [ikiaqqivik]), which literally means \"travelling through layers\" and refers to the angakkuq, the traditional Inuit concept of a shaman or medicine man, travelling through time and space to find answers to spiritual and material questions.After stepping down as Languages Commissioner she then went on to teach Inuktitut at the Pirurvik Centre in Iqaluit, and later owned and operated Malikkaat, a retail store in Iqaluit which sold Inuit arts and crafts.

The following year, he introduced his Ball Chair, a hollow sphere on a stand, open on one side to allow a person to sit within. The Ball Chair was introduced to the international public at the Asko stand at the Cologne furniture fair in 1966. The similar Bubble Chair was clear and suspended from above. Other innovative designs included his Pastil Chair (a beanbag-like molded armchair), and Tomato Chair (a seat molded between three supporting spheres). His Screw Table, as the name suggests, had the appearance of a flat head screw driven into the ground. He was awarded the American Industrial Design award in 1968.\nAarnio's designs were an important aspect of 1960s popular culture, and could often be seen as part of sets in period science-fiction films. Because his designs used very simple geometric forms, they were ideal for such productions.\nEero Aarnio continues to create new designs, including toys and furniture for children.

Aaron", "Content": "David Laurence Aaron (born August 21, 1938) is an American diplomat and writer who served in the Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton administrations. He graduated from Occidental College with a BA, and from Princeton University with an MPA. He later received an honorary Ph.D from Occidental College. He is currently director of the RAND Corporation's Center for Middle East Public Policy.\n\n\n== Background and early career ==\nAaron was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He entered the U.S. foreign service in 1962, where he served as a political and economic officer in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 1964 he was assigned to the NATO desk at the Department of State. He subsequently served as a political officer to NATO where he worked on the Nuclear Planning Group and on the Non Proliferation Treaty.  \nHe then joined the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency where he served as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), during which Aaron was a key negotiator of an agreement with the Soviet Union to reduce the risk of nuclear weapon accidents. He was then recruited to serve on Henry Kissinger's National Security Council staff during the Nixon administration, from 1972 to 1974. During that time, Aaron drafted NSSM 242 on Nuclear Strategy, which came to be known as the Schlesinger Doctrine.In 1974, on the recommendation of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Aaron became Senator Walter Mondale's legislative assistant. The following year, Aaron was task force leader of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the principal architect of the Committee's recommendations. Aaron later followed Mondale to the Jimmy Carter Presidential campaign.\n\n\n== Deputy National Security Advisor ==\nIn 1977, Aaron was asked by Brzezinski, who had been appointed the National Security Advisor, to become Deputy National Security Advisor in the administration of Jimmy Carter. Aaron was one of several former Kissinger aides appointed by Jimmy Carter to foreign policy and defense positions.During his time at the White House, Aaron made a name for himself in foreign policy circles and was recognized as a rising star in the Democratic Party. Aaron was a special envoy to Africa, Latin America, China, Israel and Europe, and became a trusted envoy on Presidential missions.  Shortly after Carter's inauguration, Aaron attended the Bilderberg Conference, in which he undertook lengthy private discussions with German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.  In Israel, Aaron worked with Moshe Dayan on the concept of \"autonomy\" for the Palestinians. This concept helped to open the door for the Camp David Agreements, which are understood to have structured peace between Egypt and Israel.\nAaron also represented the White House in talks with the Office of French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in Paris, as well as with the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street in London.  President Carter tapped Aaron to lead an inter-agency mission to structure an agreement with European nations to deploy U.S. Pershing Missiles and Ground Launched Cruise Missiles in Europe, in response to the deployment of SS-20 Intermediate Missiles by the Soviet Union.  He persuaded key governments to accept the U.S. deployments, as well as to seek negotiations with the U.S.S.R. for the future bilateral elimination of the deployments.\nAaron was also seen as a tough and sometimes controversial figure. The U.S. Ambassador in Paris complained that he was going behind his back in secret dealings with French President Giscard d'Estaing's office. In 1978, he came head to head with Director of Central Intelligence Turner of the CIA, on Turner's cutbacks and at the CIA. Aaron's image as a \"tough customer\" was intensified during an attack on North Yemen by South Yemen which was backed by the Soviet Union. President Carter, Brzezinski and Cyrus Vance were on a mission to Egypt and Israel. He remained in Washington to coordinate the U.S. response. Aaron's hard-line against Communist expansion led him to push for the dispatch of $400 million in arms to North Yemen. White House staff commented on his tough rule, one staff member was quoted as saying, \"Believe it or not, people were relieved when Brzezinski got back to town\".\n\n\n== Post-government career ==\nWhen Reagan became President in 1981, Aaron moved into the private sector, becoming Vice President for Mergers and Acquisitions at Oppenheimer and Co. and Vice Chairman of Oppenheimer International. Aaron left Oppenheimer in 1985, to write and lecture, but went on to serve on the board of directors of Oppenheimer's Quest for Value Dual Purpose Fund. Over the next several years he published three novels (State Scarlet; Agent of Influence and Crossing By Night) which were translated into ten languages. He also wrote a television documentary, \"The Lessons of the Gulf War\", hosted by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff William J. Crowe. He was also a consultant for the 20th Century Fund, from 1990 to 1992.\nAaron was involved in the election campaigns of Walter Mondale and Bill Clinton. In Mondale's campaign, Aaron played a leading role as senior consultant on foreign policy and defense. Aaron served in Clinton's foreign policy team during his election campaign.\n\n\n== OECD Ambassador tenure and aftermath ==\nIn 1993 he became United States Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, and in 1996 was assigned the additional job of White House Special Envoy for Cryptography. At the OECD he successfully negotiated the Convention to Prohibit Bribery in International Business Transactions. As Special Envoy for Cryptography, Aaron pushed for a global standard that would require computer users with high grade encryption to submit keys to their codes for scrambling data to an independent authority, which would hold them in escrow and make them available to law enforcement only under a court order. \nAt the time, he argued that unbreakable codes in the hands of terrorists would threaten every country's security.  However, he was attacked by advocates of privacy rights, who said that the compromise could easily be misused by Governments and corporations. In 1997 he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, where ironically he negotiated privacy rules with the European Union on the handling of personal data.\nAfter Clinton's second term in office, Aaron became senior international advisor at Dorsey & Whitney. He left Dorsey & Whitney in 2003 to join the RAND Corporation as a senior fellow.  At RAND, he directs The Center For Middle East Public Policy and recently produced a non fiction book, \"In their Own Words: Voices of Jihad\", published by the RAND Corporation.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDavid married Chloe Aaron in 1962, with whom he had a son; his wife died in early 2020. He is a member of the American Ditchley Foundation, the Atlantic Council, the Council on Foreign Relations, the International League of Human Rights, the National Democratic Institute, and the Pacific Council on International Policy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe Other Side of the Story, Jody Powell, Morrow 1984\n\n\n== External links ==\nDavid L.

Until her retirement in September 2011, she was Professor of English at the University of Glamorgan in south Wales. She then became an associate member of the Centre for the Study of Media and Culture in Small Nations at the University of South Wales. Aaron is known for her research and publications on Welsh literature and the writings of Welsh women.\n\n\n== Biography and output ==\nJane Aaron was born on 26 September 1951 in Aberystwyth, to the philosopher Richard Ithamar Aaron and his wife Annie Rhiannon Morgan. She graduated in English at the University of Wales, Swansea (1970\u20131973) and then studied at Somerville College, Oxford, where she gained a PhD in 1980.In 1993, she was appointed Senior Lecturer of English at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. She became Professor of English at the University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, in 1999, remaining there until her retirement in 2011.Since the early 1990s, Aaron has published a number of essays and books, and edited works for Honno Press, which specializes in the writings of Welsh women. In 1999 she edited Honno's anthology of short stories entitled, A View Across the Valley: Short Stories from Women in Wales 1850\u20131950.\nIn 1998, Aaron herself produced Pur Fel y Dur: Y Gymraes yn Llen Menywod y Bedwaredd Ganrif ar Bymtheg, an account in Welsh of the contribution by women to 19th-century Welsh literature. For this she received the Ellis Griffith Memorial Prize in 1999. She also wrote Nineteenth-Century Women's Writing in Wales: Nation, Gender and Identity (2007), for which she was awarded the Roland Mathias Prize in 2009.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Aaron_(educator)"}, {"title": "Jason Aaron", "Content": "Jason Aaron (born January 28, 1973) is an American comic book writer, known for his creator-owned series Scalped and Southern Bastards, as well as his work on Marvel series Ghost Rider, Wolverine, PunisherMAX, Thor, and The Avengers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJason Aaron was born in Jasper, Alabama. His cousin, Gustav Hasford, who wrote the semi-autobiographical novel The Short-Timers (1979), on which the feature film Full Metal Jacket (1987) was based, was a large influence on Aaron. Aaron decided he wanted to write comics as a child, and though his father was skeptical when Aaron informed him of this aspiration, his mother took Aaron to drug stores, where he would purchase comic books from spinner racks, some of which he still owned as of 2012.Aaron graduated from Shelby County High School. He then attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAaron's career in comics began in 2001 when he won a Marvel Comics talent search contest with an eight-page Wolverine story script. The story, which was published in Wolverine #175 (June 2002), gave him the opportunity to pitch subsequent ideas to editors. In 2006, Aaron made a blind submission to DC Comics's imprint Vertigo, which became his first major work, the Vietnam War story The Other Side. The Other Side was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Miniseries, and Aaron regards it as the \"second time\" he broke into the industry. Following this, Vertigo asked him to pitch other ideas, which led to Scalped, a creator-owned series with artist R. M. Gu\u00e9ra set on the fictional Prairie Rose Indian Reservation.In 2007, Aaron wrote Ripclaw: Pilot Season for Top Cow Productions. Later that year, Marvel editor Axel Alonso, who was impressed by The Other Side and Scalped, hired Aaron to write issues of Wolverine, Black Panther and eventually, an extended run on Ghost Rider that began in April 2008. In January 2008, he signed an exclusive contract with Marvel, though it would not affect his work on Scalped. In July of that year, he wrote the Penguin issue of Joker's Asylum.After a four-issue stint on Wolverine in 2007, Aaron returned to the character with the ongoing series Wolverine: Weapon X, launched to coincide with the feature film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Aaron commented, \"With Wolverine: Weapon X we'll be trying to mix things up like that from arc to arc, so the first arc is a typical sort of black ops story but the second arc will jump right into the middle of a completely different genre.\" In 2010, the series was relaunched once again as simply Wolverine. He followed this with the relaunch of The Incredible Hulk in 2011 and Thor: God of Thunder in 2012. Aaron and artist Mike Deodato collaborated on the Original Sin limited series in 2014. In 2018, Aaron relaunched Thor with Mike del Mundo and The Avengers with Ed McGuinness. In addition to his work on Marvel characters, Aaron wrote a year-long run on the Conan the Barbarian series after Marvel regained the licensing rights to the character in 2019.At the 2019 San Diego Comic Con, it was announced that Aaron's Thor storyline which depicted Jane Foster acquiring the mantle of the Thunder God would be the basis for the 2022 film Thor: Love and Thunder.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAaron moved to Kansas City, Kansas in 2000, the day after the first X-Men feature film was released.Aaron is a passionate and well known fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\nCommenting on the religious themes that run through his work, Aaron says he was raised Southern Baptist, but has since renounced religion: I\u2019ve been an atheist for many years, but I\u2019ve remained fascinated by religion. If anything, I\u2019ve become more fascinated by religion and faith after I lost mine.\"\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nNominated: 2007 Eisner Award for Best Miniseries for The Other Side.\nNominated: 2015 Eisner Award for Best Writer for Southern Bastards, Original Sin, Thor: God of Thunder and Men of Wrath.\nNominated: 2015 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series for Southern Bastards.\nRecipient: 2015 Harvey Award for Best New Series for Southern Bastards.\nNominated: 2015 Harvey Award for Best Writer for Southern Bastards.\nRecipient: 2016 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series for Southern Bastards.\nRecipient: 2016 Eisner Award for Best Writer for Southern Bastards, Star Wars, Doctor Strange, Thor and Men of Wrath.\nRecipient: 2016 Inkpot Award\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== DC Comics ===\nThe Other Side #1\u20135 (with Cameron Stewart, Vertigo, 2006) collected as The Other Side (tpb, 144 pages, 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1350-2; hc, Image, 2017, ISBN 1-5343-0222-0)\nScalped (with R.

Aaron (born 1943) is a former NASA engineer and was a flight controller during the Apollo program. He is widely credited with saving the Apollo 12 mission when it was struck by lightning soon after launch, and also played an important role during the Apollo 13 crisis.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Aaron was born in Wellington, Texas, and grew up in rural Western Oklahoma near Vinson, one of the youngest of a family of seven children. His mother was a minister, and his father was a cattle rancher. After spending a year attending Bethany Nazarene College, he transferred to Southwestern Oklahoma State University, from which he graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics. Although he had intended to teach and ranch after graduating from college, he applied for a job with NASA on the recommendation of a friend.\n\n\n== NASA career ==\n\n\n=== Gemini ===\nWhen he arrived at NASA, Aaron was trained as an EECOM, a flight controller with specific responsibility for the electrical, environmental and communications systems on board the spacecraft. By January 19, 1965, when the unmanned Gemini 2 was launched, he was already working in Mission Control as Chief EECOM Officer, which he did through 1967.\n\n\n=== Apollo ===\nAaron pivoted his work as Chief EECOM Officer of the Command & Service Module to the Apollo program in 1967 where he continued through 1969.  In 1969 he moved on to serve as Section Head, Electrical Power, Electrical & Instrumentation Systems Section, a position he held for 4 years.\n\n\n==== Apollo 12 ====\nWhen Apollo 12 launched on November 14, 1969, Aaron was on shift. Thirty-six seconds after liftoff, the spacecraft was struck by lightning, causing a power surge. Instruments began to malfunction and telemetry data became garbled. The flight director, Gerry Griffin, expected that he would have to abort the mission. However, Aaron realized that he had previously seen this odd pattern of telemetry.\nA year before the flight, Aaron had been observing a test at Kennedy Space Center when he had noticed some unusual telemetry readings. On his own initiative, he traced this anomaly back to the obscure Signal Conditioning Equipment (SCE) system, and became one of the few flight controllers who was familiar with the system and its operations. For the case that first drew his attention to the system, normal readings could be restored by putting the SCE on its auxiliary setting, which meant that it would operate even with low-voltage conditions.\nAaron surmised that this setting would also return the Apollo 12 telemetry to normal. When he made the recommendation to the Flight Director, \"Flight, try SCE to Aux\", most of his mission control colleagues had no idea what he was talking about. Both the flight director and the CAPCOM Gerald P. Carr asked him to repeat the recommendation. Aaron repeated himself and Carr responded \"What the hell's that?\" Yet he relayed the order to the crew: \"Apollo 12, Houston. Try SCE to auxiliary.\" Dick Gordon, a ground expert on the CSM as well as the Apollo 12 command module pilot, was familiar with both the location and the function of the SCE switch, and instructed Alan Bean to flip it to aux. Telemetry was immediately restored, allowing the mission to continue. This earned Aaron the lasting respect of his colleagues, who declared that he was a \"steely-eyed missile man\".\n\n\n==== Apollo 13 ====\nAaron was off duty when the Apollo 13 explosion occurred, but was quickly called to Mission Control to assist in the rescue and recovery effort. Flight Director Gene Kranz put Aaron in charge of the power supply budget. He was allowed to veto the ideas of other engineers, particularly when they affected the power usage of the modules. He was in charge of rationing the spacecraft's power during the return flight and devised an innovative power up sequence that allowed the Command Module to re-enter safely while operating on limited battery power.\nContrary to existing procedures, he ordered the instrumentation system, which included telemetry, visibility, and the transmitters for communications, to be turned on last, just before reentry, rather than first. The call was a calculated risk. Without the instrumentation system, the crew and controllers would not know for certain if the cold startup had been successful until the last possible moment before reentry. However without the change, the capsule would have exhausted its battery supply before splashdown. The procedure was a success, and the crew was recovered safely.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nAfter the Apollo Lunar Surface program ended, Aaron remained at NASA in the Spacecraft Software Division rising through the ranks of technical assistant to the chief in 1973 to assistant chief in 1979 before taking on the role of chief  1981-1984.Beginning in 1984, he worked on  Space Station Freedom project becoming manager of Johnson Space Center's space station projects office during 1989. Four years later, however, he was forced to resign from the job after Texas Senator Robert Krueger blamed him for $500 million of overspending on the station project.Aaron became a manager in Johnson Space Center's Engineering Directorate in 1993, and stayed in the directorate until his retirement from NASA in 2000.\n\n\n== In film ==\nAaron was portrayed by actor Loren Dean in the 1995 movie Apollo 13. Aaron was also played by John Travis in the 1998 mini-series From the Earth to the Moon. He was interviewed in the PBS documentary Apollo 13: To the Edge and Back, and in two History Channel documentaries about Mission Control, Failure Is Not an Option and Beyond the Moon: Failure Is Not an Option 2.\nThe 2015 science fiction film The Martian contains a reference to the \"steely-eyed missile man\" title bestowed on Aaron, as does the Legends of Tomorrow second-season episode \"Moonshot.\"\nIn 2017, Aaron appeared in David Fairhead's documentary Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References and external links ==\nKranz, Gene (2001).

Looking back in adulthood, he has stated \"I\u2019ve been emo my whole fucking life\". In middle school and high school, he was the vocalist of a pop punk, that was influenced by Hit the Lights and Metro Station and saw Puckett using overt auto-tune.

This led to him dropping out of high school and moving to Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPuckett began his career as a songwriter, working with artists such as Travis Mills, DRAM, Icona Pop and Kiiara.

His music often merges trap instrumentals with autotuned and distorted vocals using melodies reminiscent of pop punk and emo. Complex writer Joe Price described his sound as \"Travis Scott meets Green Day\". Pitchfork writer Jayson Greene described it as \"sampl[ing] Panic! At the Disco, alternately whining like Blink\u2019s Tom DeLonge and warbling like, well, Chief Keef over 808 claps. It\u2019s all mixed together and atomized, a fever dream of Adidas tracksuits and dreads and emo power ballads\". Hypefresh.co described his music as \"mixing pop-punk attitude with the new genre of autotuned rap\".His music was cited as an influence by Yungblud for his album Weird!.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== With Boyfriendz ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Aaron"}, {"title": "Madeline Aaron", "Content": "Madeline Aaron (born October 25, 1994) is an American former pair skater.

He dominated chess in India in the 1960s to the 1980s, was the national champion of India nine times between 1959 and 1981. He is India's first player to be awarded the International Master title, and is one of the key figures in introducing international chess practices to India; until the 1960s, Indian chess (known as chaturanga) was often played using many local traditional variants (e.g. in lieu of castling, the king could execute a knights move once, if it had not been checked). Aaron helped popularize the international variety, forming many chess groups and urging players to study openings and other formal chess literature.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in Toungoo (colonial Burma) of Indian parents, Aaron grew up in Tamil Nadu, India, where he did his schooling. He then did his B.Sc. from Allahabad University. Aaron was Indian National Champion nine times (out of 14 championships between 1959\u20131981), including a run of five consecutive titles between 1969 and 1973.

In 1962, he won the Arjuna Award for Indian sportsmen, the first-ever chess player to be so honoured.These wins at the Asian level qualified him for the Interzonals, and in 1962, he played in the Stockholm interzonal and although finishing last (23rd place), his game was notable for the defeats he inflicted on grandmasters Lajos Portisch and Wolfgang Uhlmann.Aaron also played thrice with the Indian team at the Chess Olympiads. He captained the Indian team at Leipzig 1960 (+2 \u201310 =8) including a win over Max Euwe, and at Varna 1962 (+7 \u20136 =4), including another victory over Lajos Portisch.

His son, Arvin, is also a well known journalist.\n\n\n=== Contributions to Indian chess culture ===\nHaving emerged in an environment with a minimal chess culture, Aaron was very sensitive to the growth of chess awareness in India. He did much to further chess as the Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Chess Association (1977 and 1997) and also as chairman of the All India Chess Federation. It was 17 years before India had its second International Master, V. Ravikumar (1978), and it had its first grandmaster (Viswanathan Anand) only in 1988.\nAt the time of the 2013 World Championship match in Chennai, Manuel Aaron was still active in Indian chess circles.\n\n\n== Notable games ==\nManuel Aaron vs Max Euwe, Leipzig ol (Men) qual-B 1960, Indian Game: Capablanca Variation (A47), 1\u20130\nLajos Portisch vs Manuel Aaron, Varna 1962, King's Indian Defense: Fianchetto Variation, Classical Main Line (E69), 0-1\nWolfgang Uhlmann vs Manuel Aaron, Stockholm izt 1962, King's Indian Defense: Fianchetto Variation, Classical Main Line (E69), 0-1\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Aaron"}, {"title": "Max Aaron", "Content": "Maxwell Theodore \"Max\" Aaron (born February 25, 1992) is an American former figure skater.

Publishers Weekly wrote that Heaven's Queen was a \"satisfying conclusion.\"Aaron's fantasy work on the Eli Monpress series revolves around a \"legendary and lovable con man.\" The first book in the series, The Spirit Thief (2010) starts slow, according to the Publishers Weekly, but becomes a \"romp of lighthearted fantasy.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOn May 11, 2016, Rachel Aaron won the Best Fantasy Audie Award for her work, Nice Dragons Finish Last, as narrated by Vikas Adam.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Eli Monpress ===\nThe Spirit Thief (2010)\nThe Spirit Rebellion (2010)\nThe Spirit Eater (2010)\nThe above three works are collected in the omnibus The Legend of Eli Monpress (2012)\nThe Spirit War (2012)\nSpirit's End (2012)\nThe above two works are collected in the omnibus The Revenge of Eli Monpress (2012)\nSpirit's Oath (2012 novella, set before the events of The Spirit Thief)\n\n\n=== Paradox ===\nFortune's Pawn (2013) as Rachel Bach\nHonor's Knight (2014) as Rachel Bach\nHeaven's Queen (2014) as Rachel Bach\n\n\n=== Heartstrikers ===\nNice Dragons Finish Last (2014)\n\"Mother of the Year\" (2016 short story)\nOne Good Dragon Deserves Another (2015)\nNo Good Dragon Goes Unpunished  (2016)\nA Dragon of a Different Color (2017)\nLast Dragon Standing (2018)\n\n\n=== DFZ ===\nSpinoff of the Heartstrikers series, set 20 years later.\n\nMinimum Wage Magic (2018)\nPart-Time Gods (2019)\nNight Shift Dragons (2020)\n\n\n=== Attack on Titan ===\nGarrison Girl (2018)\n\n\n=== FFO ===\nForever Fantasy Online (2018) with Travis Bach\nLast Bastion (2019) with Travis Bach\nForever King (November 12, 2019) with Travis Bach\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nRachel Aaron at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aaron"}, {"title": "Robert Aaron", "Content": "Robert Arron Vineberg (stage name Robert Aaron) is a Canadian jazz musician.\nAccording to John Leland of the New York Times \"Mr. Aaron played flute, saxophone, clarinet and piano, then taught himself guitar, trumpet, bassoon, French horn and other instruments.\" \nHe performed for rapper Wyclef Jean's band from 1998 to 2008. \nRobin Caulden of Press-Republican said \"He's played with everybody \u2014 Afrika Bambataa, B52s, Blondie, Chic, David Bowie, Heavy D, James Chance and The Contortions, RZA, Stetsasonic, William Vivanco and Wu-Tang Clan.\"In 1981, he first started work with James Chance for the group James White and the Blacks; and has toured with him since in Europe and Japan.\nHe played sax on David Bowie's 1983 hit \"Let's Dance\". \nIn 2010, Aaron released his album Trouble Man, which Michael Daly of the Daily Beast called \"artistically adventurous but commercially unsuccessful\".\nFolk singer Eric Andersen, who used Aaron on several albums as a producer and performer, said \"He is telepathic as a musician.

Aaron is best known for winning the 1973 Masters Tournament. He is also known for an error in the 1968 Masters Tournament, when he entered a 4 instead of a 3 on Roberto De Vicenzo's scorecard, which kept De Vicenzo out of a playoff for the championship.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThomas Dean Aaron was born on February 22, 1937 in Gainesville, Georgia. He began playing golf at age 12 and won two Georgia Amateur titles, two Southeastern Amateur events and two Georgia Open crowns, despite not having a golf course in his hometown.\n\n\n== College career ==\nAaron attended the University of Florida, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Fraternity (Beta Zeta Chapter). While he was a Florida student, he played for the Florida Gators men's golf team from 1956 to 1959, was a member of the Gators' 1956 Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship team, and won the individual SEC championship in 1957 and 1958. He lost the U.S. Amateur final to Charles Coe in 1958, was a member of the 1959 Walker Cup team, and won the Western Amateur in 1960. He was recognized as an All-American in 1958 and 1959. Aaron graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1960, and was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\"\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nAaron turned pro in 1960. His first professional victory came at the 1969 Canadian Open. Although the event is historically considered a PGA Tour event it was not that year. The following year he gained his first PGA Tour victory at the Atlanta Classic. In 1972, he won the Troph\u00e9e Lanc\u00f4me in France. Aaron's best money year was 1972, when he finished in ninth place on the PGA Tour money list.\nAaron won the Masters Tournament in 1973, which was his one major championship. He also finished in the top ten at the Masters from 1967 to 1970. His only other top ten major championship finishes came at the PGA Championship in 1965 and 1972. In 2000, he made the cut at the Masters at the age of 63, breaking a record previously held by Gary Player.\nAaron played for the U.S. team in the Ryder Cup in 1969 and 1973, and had a record of one win, one tie and four losses.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Aaron played on the Senior PGA Tour, winning $3,646,302. The 1992 Kaanapali Classic was his last professional win.\nAaron was a student of golf instructor Manuel de la Torre.\nAaron is also known for being the playing partner of Argentinian Roberto De Vicenzo for the final round of the 1968 Masters Tournament. On the seventeenth hole, Aaron incorrectly recorded a par 4 on De Vicenzo's scorecard, when his partner had actually scored a birdie 3 for the hole. Because De Vicenzo signed the scorecard without correcting the error, PGA rules required him to stand by the incorrect, higher score. Instead of a De Vicenzo\u2013Bob Goalby playoff for the green jacket, Goalby won the tournament outright due to the technicality.\nIronically, Aaron's 4th round playing partner at the 1973 Masters, Johnny Miller, recorded a higher score when keeping Aaron's card. Aaron caught the mistake.He was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\n\n== Amateur wins (8) ==\n1957 SEC Championship (individual), Georgia Amateur\n1958 SEC Championship (individual), Southeastern Amateur\n1959 Sunnehanna Amateur\n1960 Western Amateur, Georgia Amateur, Southeastern Amateur\n\n\n== Professional wins (9) ==\n\n\n=== PGA Tour wins (2) ===\nPGA Tour playoff record (0\u20134)\n\n\n=== Other wins (6) ===\n1957 Georgia Open (as an amateur)\n1960 Georgia Open\n1969 Canadian Open\n1972 Troph\u00e9e Lanc\u00f4me, ABC Japan vs USA Golf Matches\n1975 Georgia Open\n\n\n=== Senior PGA Tour wins (1) ===\nSenior PGA Tour playoff record (0\u20132)\n\n\n== Major championships ==\n\n\n=== Wins (1) ===\n\n\n=== Results timeline ===\nAmateur\n\nProfessional\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\nWD = withdrew\nR256, R128, R64, R32, R16, QF, SF = Round in which player lost in match play\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\nSource for The Masters: www.masters.com\nSource for U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur: USGA Championship Database\nSource for The British Open: www.opengolf.com\nSource for PGA Championship: PGA Championship Media Guide\nSource for 1959 British Amateur: The Glasgow Herald, May 26, 1959, pg. 6.\n\n\n== Results in senior majors ==\nResults may not be in chronological order\n\nNote: The Senior British Open Championship did not become a major until 2003.\nNYF = Tournament not yet founded\nDNP = did not play\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\nWD = withdrew\nDQ = disqualified\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nYellow background for top-10.\n\n\n== U.S. national team appearances ==\nAmateur\n\nWalker Cup: 1959 (winners)Professional\n\nRyder Cup: 1969 (winners), 1973 (winners)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of American Ryder Cup golfers\nList of Kappa Alpha Order members\nList of Florida Gators men's golfers on the PGA Tour\nList of University of Florida alumni\nList of University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame members\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTommy Aaron at the PGA Tour official site", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Aaron"}, {"title": "Varun Aaron", "Content": "Varun Raymond Aaron (born 29 October 1989) is an Indian cricketer from Jamshedpur.

He realized that keeping in shape was a lifelong responsibility and became a student of yoga in 1991 and a teacher in 1997. He travelled across the world visiting numerous yoga ashrams and retreat centers, studying with yoga teachers including Bryan Kest, Rod Stryker, Swami Rama, as well as with other spiritual masters in the Himalayas.Star arrived in Manhattan in 2001 and within a short time was offering retreats in different countries. It was during a retreat in Hawaii that Star and his longtime student, Adam, first discussed creating \"a community that is yoga-based\u2026 and where people can heal their spirits.\" Six years later, they purchased property in Costa Rica and formed what is today known as Blue Osa.Star popularized the idea of practicing Hot Nude Yoga which garnered a large following of men in the gay community of New York. Since then it has spread out in Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. He started the Hot Nude Yoga movement in Chelsea, New York in 2001 in the building on the Southwest corner of 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue.Star speaks on various topics, most commonly on freedom of oneself and how to be free along with being comfortable with oneself.

Joshua Stein, editor  for OUT Magazine, who has attended the class wrote that the quality of yoga was diminished by heightened sensuality and according to The Associated Press, Hot Nude Yoga seems to be a \"form of sensualized tantric yoga practiced nude.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Aaron"}, {"title": "Ann Kristin Aar\u00f8nes", "Content": "Ann Kristin \"Anka\" Aar\u00f8nes (born 19 January 1973) is a Norwegian former footballer.

He is the author of the Rivers of London series of novels. He also wrote two Doctor Who serials in the late 1980s and spin-off novels from Doctor Who and Blake's 7.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\nBorn in Camden, Aaronovitch is the son of the economist Sam Aaronovitch who was a senior member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and the younger brother of actor Owen Aaronovitch and journalist David Aaronovitch. He attended Holloway School.Aaronovitch lives in Wimbledon.\n\n\n== Doctor Who and television work ==\nAaronovitch wrote two Doctor Who serials, Remembrance of the Daleks (1988) and Battlefield (1989), for BBC television, and also the novelization of the former.He wrote one episode for Casualty (1990) and was then a regular writer on science fiction series Jupiter Moon.He subsequently wrote or co-wrote three Doctor Who spin-off novels in the Virgin Publishing New Adventures range; he created the character Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart who became a semi-regular in the New Adventures. He has also written a novel and several short stories published by Big Finish Productions featuring the character of Bernice Summerfield, who was originally developed in the New Adventures. He also co-wrote a Doctor Who audio drama for Big Finish, and has written a number of Blake's 7 spin-off audio dramas.\n\n\n=== Proposed serials of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d ===\nKnight Fall\nIn May 1987, Aaronovitch submitted \u201cKnight Fall\u201d to the Doctor Who production office for Season 25. The story concerned privatization. Script editor Andrew Cartmel liked the story ideas, but felt that the script was inappropriate for the series and had too many supporting characters.Transit\nAfter failing to feature Aaronovitch's \u201cKnight Fall\u201d storyline to production, Aaronovitch submitted a story in June 1987, entitled as \u201cTransit\u201d. The story would see the Doctor and Ace in the future, land in a metro station, and discover transportation portals that could lead any body throughout the Solar System, but one of the portals leads a gate way to hell. Even though it is unexplainable to how Aaronovitch's scripts of \u201cTransit\u201d never came to fruition, he would adapt the story as a book for Virgin New Adventures series in December 1992.Bad Destination\nDuring Summer of 1988, Aaronovitch submitted a three-part adventure story for Doctor Who\u2019s 27th Season (which never came to fruition), and was called \u201dBad Destination\u201d. The story would feature The Doctor seeing Ace as a captain of a hospital spaceship which is being under attack by the Metatraxi. The story, however, was abandoned when, in September 1989, the BBC cancelled Doctor Who after its 26 Season, due to declining audiences.

He is a regular columnist for The Times and the author of Paddling to Jerusalem: An Aquatic Tour of Our Small Country (2000), Voodoo Histories: the role of Conspiracy Theory in Modern History (2009) and Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists (2016). He won the Orwell Prize for political journalism in 2001, and the What the Papers Say \"Columnist of the Year\" award for 2003. He previously wrote for The Independent and The Guardian.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAaronovitch is the son of communist intellectual and economist Sam Aaronovitch, and brother of actor Owen Aaronovitch and author and screenwriter Ben Aaronovitch. His parents were atheists whose \"faith was Marxism\", according to Aaronovitch, and he is ethnically half Jewish and half Irish. He has written that he was brought up \"to react to wealth with a puritanical pout\".Aaronovitch attended Gospel Oak Primary School until 1965, Holloway County Comprehensive (now Holloway School) until 1968, and William Ellis School from 1968 to 1972, all in London. He studied Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford. Aaronovitch completed his education at the Victoria University of Manchester, graduating in 1978 with a 2:1 BA (Hons) in History.\nWhile at Manchester, Aaronovitch was a member of the 1975 University Challenge team that lost in the first round after answering most questions with the name of a Marxist (\"Trotsky\", \"Lenin\", \"Karl Marx\" or \"Che Guevara\"). The tactics were a protest against the fact that the University of Oxford and Cambridge University were allowed to enter each of their colleges into the contest as a separate team, even though the colleges were not universities in themselves.Aaronovitch was initially a Eurocommunist, and was active in the National Union of Students (NUS). There he got to know the president at the time, Charles Clarke, who later became Home Secretary. Aaronovitch himself succeeded Trevor Phillips as president of the NUS from 1980 to 1982. He was elected on a Left Alliance ticket.\n\n\n== Career in journalism ==\nAaranovitch began his media career in the early 1980s as a television researcher and later producer for the ITV programme Weekend World. In 1988, he began working at the BBC as founding editor of the political current affairs programme On the Record.\nHe moved to print journalism in 1995, working for The Independent and Independent on Sunday as chief leader writer, television critic, parliamentary sketch writer and columnist until the end of 2002.\nHe began contributing to The Guardian and The Observer in 2003 as a columnist and feature writer. Aaronovitch's columns appeared in The Guardian's G2 section. His desire for his pieces to appear on the main comment pages, according to Peter Wilby, was reportedly vetoed by the section editor, Seumas Milne, although Aaronovitch himself does not know if Milne was involved in the decision. Since June 2005, he has written a regular column for The Times. He has also been a columnist for The Jewish Chronicle. In addition, Aaronovitch has written for a variety of other major British news and opinion publications, such as the New Statesman. In addition, he has written for New Humanist, and is an \"honorary associate\" of its publisher, the Rationalist Association.\nAaronovitch also presents or contributes to radio and television programmes, including the BBC's Have I Got News for You and BBC News 24. In 2004 he presented The Norman Way, a three-part BBC Radio 4 documentary looking at r\u00e9gime change in 1066.\nAaronovitch also hosted the BBC series The Blair Years (2007), which examined the prime ministership of Tony Blair. Some journalists were unimpressed with Aaronovitch or dismissed the series.\n\n\n== Political views ==\nAaronovitch gave strong support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since the invasion he has taken the view that it liberated Iraqis, and has played down the significance of Iraq's putative weapons of mass destruction. However, he wrote in 2003: \"If nothing is eventually found, I \u2013 as a supporter of the war \u2013 will never believe another thing that I am told by our government, or that of the US ever again. And, more to the point, neither will anyone else. Those weapons had better be there somewhere.\" On 7 September 2018, he labelled people who ask him about the article \"lamebrains\". He remains a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Tony Blair.In late 2005, Aaronovitch was co-author, with Oliver Kamm and journalist Francis Wheen, of a complaint to The Guardian, after it published an apology to Noam Chomsky for an interview by Emma Brockes, in which she asserted that Chomsky had denied the Srebrenica massacre. A Guardian readers' editor found that the newspaper had misrepresented Chomsky's position on the Srebrenica massacre, and that judgement was upheld in May 2006 by an external ombudsman, John Willis.In his column of 5 September 2013, Aaronovitch criticised the Labour leader Ed Miliband for providing no alternative to military intervention in Syria, after the use of chemical weapons in the Ghouta attacks of 21 August 2013. For Aaronovitch, \"politically [Miliband] is not a presence at all, he is an absence\" and \"is neither hunter nor prey, he is scavenger. He is a political vulture.\"During 2013, Aaronovitch became the chairman of the human rights organisation Index on Censorship, succeeding Jonathan Dimbleby in the role.In May 2014, he criticised Glenn Greenwald's involvement in the Edward Snowden NSA revelations, and characterised Greenwald as \"a stilted writer of overlong, dishonest and repetitive polemics.\"In August 2014, Aaronovitch was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.In 2016, he endorsed the United Kingdom's continued membership of the European Union in the 23 June referendum. Aaronovitch later said that Brexit would eventually be reversed as the number of older voters, who typically voted for Britain to leave the European Union, gradually die.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAaronovitch lives in London with his wife and three daughters.He is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.\n\n\n== Works ==\nPaddling to Jerusalem: An Aquatic Tour of Our Small Country (Fourth Estate, 2000) ISBN 978-1-84115-540-1\nNo Excuses for Terror, a 45-minute documentary film that \"criticizes how the anti-Israel views of the far-left and far-right have permeated the mainstream media and political discourse.\"\nBlaming the Jews, a 45-minute documentary film that evaluates anti-Semitism in Arab media and culture.\nGod and the Politicians, 28 September 2005, a documentary film that looks at the important question of the increasing religious influence on politics in the UK\nVoodoo Histories: The Role of Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History, Jonathan Cape, 2009, ISBN 978-0-224-07470-4 Published in the US in 2010 by Riverhead Books, ISBN 978-1-59448-895-5\nParty Animals: My Family and Other Communists.

He lives in the United Kingdom and from 1976 has been a professor of pharmacometrics at the University of Manchester. In the interest of promoting the effective development of drugs, the main focus of his work is optimizing pharmacological models, the design of clinical studies, and data analysis and interpretation in the field of population pharmacokinetics. From 1985 to 2010 Aarons was an editor emeritus of the Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics and is a former executive editor of the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology.\n\n\n== Contribution to pharmacology ==\n\n\n=== Data modelling ===\nMuch of Aarons' work focuses on building an understanding of how the effects of drugs or toxic agents are managed in humans. In 2009 he co-authored a paper that aimed to explore an approach to the modelling of effects on people by drugs and toxic agents \"based on the underlying physiology and pathology of the biological processes,...[ and to review]...the current status of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic modelling, and outline a conceptual framework that may be helpful in advancing the field.\" A model was proposed that included the kinetics of the substance as a part of the process. To some extent, this was a challenge to the widely-accepted dose/effect concept in pharmacology and toxicology at the time which assumed that the exposure/dose of a drug or a toxin is related to the effects on the patient, beneficial or toxic. The paper explained the purposes of data modelling as being to describe complex data, test hypotheses and make predictions, and noted when a drug interacts with a patient, there is a \"chain of events at the molecular level, cellular level, organ/physiological system level, and whole-body level...[and ]... in principle, modelling may be performed at each of these levels.\" The effect on a patient could be therapeutic or possibly result in adverse outcomes. The authors concluded that including the systems biology model they discussed in the paper into conventional PKPD modelling would require further collaboration to make it robust but able to be clearly defined.\n\n\n=== Design of scientific investigations ===\nAarons has defined pharmacokinetics (PK) as the study of the complex chain of events that links a dose of drugs administered to a patient and the expected effect or response. PK is based on analysing the concentration of drugs and tracking how they are absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted within the patient. Some of his work has involved using optimal design theory to explore what makes a successful scientific investigation for pharmacokinetic studies and has said that this \"involves the selection and a careful balance of a number of design factors, including the number and location of measurement times and the number of subjects to include in the study.\" According to Aarons, population pharmacokinetics studies which focus on what happens to the substances administered to a patient would need specific design factors that apply \"statistical experimental design principles to non-linear population pharmacokinetic models.\"  A later paper co-authored by Aarons, reviews the different approaches to optimal design of population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments and notes that some of the options may raise concerns at to their practicality. The paper did, however, conclude \"that as the awareness about the benefits of this approach increases, more people will embrace it and ultimately will lead to more efficient population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments.\"\n\n\n=== Enterohepatic circulation ===\nResearch by Aarons has focused on enterohepatic cycling (EHC) which refers to the process whereby a drug goes through the liver and biliary tract for excretion and is released into the small intestine, where it can be reabsorbed back into circulation and subsequently returned to the liver. This can cause liver damage and the half life and duration of a drug to be increased. Aarons and his team stressed that knowing the extent of EHC is invaluable in deciding whether or not the in vitro characteristics of a drug - i.e. those taking place outside of a living organism - will have any effect on the overall process of absorption in vivo, or when it is taking place inside the organism. Aarons had earlier been involved in research on the area under the curve (AUC).  This is a pharmacokinetic statistic used to describe the total exposure to a drug - specifically the concentration of a drug in body fluids such as blood -  and is useful because it gives insight into the extent of exposure to a drug and its clearance rate from the body. The research was seen as important in the \"design of sampling protocols for accurate determination of AUC(0\u2013 \u221e) for drugs subject to enterohepatic cycling.\"\n\n\n=== Drug-drug interactions ===\nDrug\u2212drug interactions (DDI) are one of the primary causes of adverse drug reactions which can result in serious health issues. In 1981, Aaron said that because of the practice at the time of multiple drug therapy, there was a good chance of drug-drug interaction. He reviewed the literature around pharmacokinetic interactions when there is a change of the disposition of the interacting drugs, in particular, the mechanisms that cause these changes. He noted that in drug-drug interactions both drugs are often affected, and it is necessary to develop \"a model that describes the disposition of all interacting species.\" In 2011 Aaron was part of a team that critiqued the then two-fold method of assessing drug-drug interaction and proposed that there would be less bias if predictions were made using a wider range of data collected and the allowance of variability was included in the process. A research programme in 2017 that Aarons was involved in explored the mechanistic prediction of the oral bioavailability differences observed between the original formulation of a drug and that on its release. The study predicted that bioavailability of the original drug was due to reduced deactivation by an enzyme CYP3A4 in the intestine This was proven in the study, which concluded that  \"this work highlights the importance that formulations can have [when there are] clinically-relevant DDI involving CYP3A substrates...[and that]... this aspect is generally overlooked when evaluating DDIs in drug development.\" Aarons had collaborated on earlier research published in 2008 used physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK) to \"evaluate the potential CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of a drug in development.\" There had been a paper that described the methodology of the trial, and the second paper analysed the results, which showed that although the drug-drug interaction was slightly less than predicted, valuable assessment of the interaction was achieved and could be applied in drug development.\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Aarons"}, {"title": "Mark Aarons", "Content": "Mark Aarons (born 25 December 1951) is an Australian journalist and author.

Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. His primary areas of research are quantum computing and computational complexity theory. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAaronson grew up in the United States, though he spent a year in Asia when his father\u2014a science writer turned public-relations executive\u2014was posted to Hong Kong. He enrolled in a school there that permitted him to skip ahead several years in math, but upon returning to the US, he found his education restrictive, getting bad grades and having run-ins with teachers. He enrolled in The Clarkson School, a program for gifted youngsters run by Clarkson University, which enabled Aaronson to apply for colleges while only in his freshman year of high school. He was accepted into Cornell University, where he obtained his BSc in computer science in 2000, and where he resided at the Telluride House. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, for his PhD, which he got in 2004 under the supervision of Umesh Vazirani.Aaronson had shown ability in mathematics from an early age, teaching himself calculus at the age of 11, provoked by symbols in a babysitter's textbook. He discovered computer programming at age 11, and felt he lagged behind peers, who had already been coding for years. In part due to Aaronson getting into advanced mathematics before getting into computer programming, he felt drawn to theoretical computing, particularly computational complexity theory. At Cornell, he became interested in quantum computing and devoted himself to computational complexity and quantum computing.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter postdoctorates at the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Waterloo, he took a faculty position at MIT in 2007.  His primary area of research is quantum computing and computational complexity theory more generally.\nIn the summer of 2016 he moved from MIT to the University of Texas at Austin as David J. Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science and as the founding director of UT Austin's new Quantum Information Center.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nAaronson is one of two winners of the 2012 Alan T. Waterman Award.\nBest Student Paper Awards at the Computational Complexity Conference for the papers \"Limitations of Quantum Advice and One-Way Communication\" (2004)  and \"Quantum Certificate Complexity\" (2003).\nDanny Lewin Best Student Paper Award at the Symposium on Theory of Computing for the paper \"Lower Bounds for Local Search by Quantum Arguments\" (2004).\n2017 Simons Investigator\nHe was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 \"for contributions to quantum computing and computational complexity\".\nHe was awarded the 2020 ACM Prize in Computing \"for groundbreaking contributions to quantum computing\".\n\n\n== Popular work ==\nHe is a founder of the Complexity Zoo wiki, which catalogs all classes of computational complexity. He is the author of the much-read blog \"Shtetl-Optimized\".In the interview to Scientific American he answers why his blog is called shtetl-optimized, and about his preoccupation to the past:\n\nShtetls were Jewish villages in pre-Holocaust Eastern Europe. They\u2019re where all my ancestors came from\u2014some actually from the same place (Vitebsk) as Marc Chagall, who painted the fiddler on the roof. I watched Fiddler many times as a kid, both the movie and the play.  And every time, there was a jolt of recognition, like: \u201cSo that\u2019s the world I was designed to inhabit. All the aspects of my personality that mark me out as weird today, the obsessive reading and the literal-mindedness and even the rocking back and forth\u2014I probably have them because back then they would\u2019ve made me a better Talmud scholar, or something.\u201d\nHe also wrote the essay \"Who Can Name The Bigger Number?\". The latter work, widely distributed in academic computer science, uses the concept of Busy Beaver Numbers as described by Tibor Rad\u00f3 to illustrate the limits of computability in a pedagogic environment.\nHe has also taught a graduate-level survey course, \"Quantum Computing Since Democritus\", for which notes are available online, and have been published as a book by Cambridge University Press.  It weaves together disparate topics into a cohesive whole, including quantum mechanics, complexity, free will, time travel, the anthropic principle and more. Many of these interdisciplinary applications of computational complexity were later fleshed out in his article, \"Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity\".  Since then, Aaronson published a book entitled Quantum Computing Since Democritus based on the course.\nAn article of Aaronson's, \"The Limits of Quantum Computers\", was published in Scientific American, and he was a guest speaker at the 2007 Foundational Questions in Science Institute conference. Aaronson is frequently cited in the non-academic press, such as Science News, The Age, ZDNet, Slashdot, New Scientist, The New York Times, and Forbes magazine.\n\n\n== Love Communications plagiarism ==\nAaronson was the subject of media attention in October 2007, when he accused Australian advertising agency Love Communications of plagiarizing a lecture he wrote on quantum mechanics in an advertisement of theirs.  He alleged that a commercial for Ricoh Australia by Sydney-based agency Love Communications appropriated content almost verbatim from the lecture. Aaronson received an email from the agency claiming to have sought legal advice and saying they did not believe that they were in violation of his copyright.\nDissatisfied, Aaronson pursued the matter, and the agency settled the dispute without admitting wrongdoing by making a charitable contribution to two science organizations of his choice.  Concerning this matter, Aaronson stated, \"Someone suggested [on my blog] a cameo with the models but if it was between that and a free printer, I think I'd take the printer.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAaronson is married to computer scientist Dana Moshkovitz.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScott Aaronson at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\nAaronson's blog\nAaronson homepage\nUT Austin Quantum Information Center homepage", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Aaronson"}, {"title": "Stephanie Aaronson", "Content": "Stephanie Aaronson is an American economist.

Currently, Aaronson also serves as an advisory board member for the Journal of Economic Perspectives, DC Representative on the Board of the American Economic Association's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. and as a member of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Strategy Group on Covid and Rental Evictions.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAaronson is a labor economist. Over her career, her research has been in the domain of macroeconomic activity, including monetary policy, inflation and labor force participation in the United States.\n\n\n=== Labor force participation ===\nMost recently, Aaronson's work has contributed to the understanding of the current labor force participation rate in the United States and what has caused it to fluctuate. Aaronson has stated that she is interested in studying how American economic institutions can be improved to benefit all citizens. In particular, she is focused on understanding how to optimize labor market conditions in order to reduce unemployment.\n\n\n==== Long-run decline in U.S. labor force participation ====\nAaronson's research has investigated the long-run trend of declining labor force participation in the U.S. since the early 2000s. According to Aaronson and her colleagues, this decline has been significant and is likely to persist. Moreover, this trend has important consequences for the labor supply in the American economy. Her research explains the relative importance of cyclical and structural factors in causing the recent decline. Her findings suggest that changes in the business cycle had a greater impact on the decline in labor force participation in the early 2000s, as the observed decline corresponded with the 2001 recession and relatively poor economic conditions. However, the continuation of the decline is better explained by structural demographic factors. Most notably, these include the increased portion of the population in older age groups, as they are more likely to have lower labor force participation rates. In addition, their findings also emphasize other structural factors, such as the stabilization of the female labor force participation rate, the decreased labor force participation rate for adult men, and the effect of young people entering the labor force at a later age due to increased years spent in school.Aaronson and her colleagues have since extended their analysis of the long-run trend for the American labor force participation rate. Their most recent research has re-emphasized the importance of structural factors in explaining the long-run trend of declining labor force participation. According to her findings, the decline in labor force participation is not primarily the result of the recession caused by 2008 financial crisis, but rather structural changes in the economy are the main causal factor. In fact, the beginning of the decline in labor force participation pre-dates the financial crisis. The most significant of these changes is the aging of the Baby Boomer generation which they argue can account for approximately 50% of the decline. Her findings also demonstrate that a decrease in labor force participation among youth has been a significant contributing factor. They note that neither of these effects have been offset by the rise in labor force participation among older workers due to improvements in health and longevity. Using this data, they project that labor force participation will continue to decline and reach as low as 61% by 2022.\n\n\n==== The business cycle and the labor force participation rate ====\nSimilarly, Aaronson's research has contributed to the understanding of how changes in the business cycle affect labor force participation among different groups of workers in the U.S. economy. This research adds to the findings of economist Arthur Okun in 1973. Okun's research looked at the relationship between a \"high pressure\" economy and upward mobility. He found that economies characterized by high rates of expansion supported the upward mobility of workers in that economy. Aaronson and her colleagues' findings corroborated Okun's earlier research. They found that the relationship between labor force participation and the economic expansion was positive and was experienced by both more advantaged and less advantaged groups. This effect held whether the economy was expanding or contracting. However, changes in the business cycle had a relatively greater effect on the labor force participation of disadvantaged groups, including Hispanics, African Americans and people with less than a college degree, compared to whites. In addition, they found that the further expansion of an already strong economy still increased labor force participation among certain groups, particularly African American women with less than a college degree, and that these benefits held over time.\n\n\n==== The exchange rate and employment instability ====\nRelated to labor force participation, Aaronson has also done research on the relationship between the exchange rate and employment instability. This research takes into account the impact of economic globalization on labor force participation in the U.S. economy. Aaronson and her colleagues looked at how fluctuations in the exchange rate affect workers likelihood of changing jobs or switching industries. Their findings showed that the effect varies between employment sectors, and also depends on whether the movement in the exchange rate occurs on the import or export side. In manufacturing sectors, appreciation of the U.S. dollar makes it more likely that workers will keep their jobs and remain in the industry in which they are currently employed. For non-manufacturing sectors, the effect depends on whether the fluctuation in the exchange rate occurs on the export or import side. An appreciation in the export exchange rate increases job stability, whereas an appreciation in the import exchange rate makes worker movement between industries more likely.\n\n\n=== Additional research ===\nAaronson and economist Andrew Figura investigated the consequences of inaccurate measurements of the number of hours worked over the business cycle on important macroeconomic phenomena, such as the markup of price over marginal cost and increasing returns to scale, as well as its implications for previously published research. They note that most research currently uses data from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, which measures the number of hours paid as opposed to the aggregate number of hours worked. They argue that there is a significant discrepancy between these two measurements that may bias the results of existing research, in particular when accounting for the number of hours worked by salaried employees. Because research has relied on the number of paid hours instead of the number of hours worked, they find that current data understates the total number of hours worked by 5%. It also misstates cyclical movements in the workweek by 27%. Taking these inaccurate measurements into account, they find that productivity growth between 2000 and 2004 has been understated, while productivity growth between 1994 and 2000 has been overstated. These findings have significant implications as they affect the accuracy of data used in academic research and policy making decisions.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nAaronson's research has been cited in a number of prominent American news publications, including The New York Times and The Economist. Both publications reference Aaronson's research about the observed long-run trend of declining labor force participation in the U.S.. In particular, they highlight the structural causes behind the decline, including the aging of the population, among other factors.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Aaronson"}, {"title": "Stuart A.

He has authored more than 500 publications and holds over 50 patents, and was the Jane B. and Jack R. Aron Professor of Neoplastic Diseases and Chairman of Oncological Sciences at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City until March 2013, when he assumed the title of Founding Chair Emeritus of the Department of Oncological Sciences. The current Chairman of Oncological Sciences is Ramon E. Parsons.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAaronson graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1962, with a degree in chemistry. He earned his M.D. from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center in 1966, and completed a fellowship at the University of Cambridge in England and an internship in medicine at Moffitt Hospital in San Francisco.In 1967, Aaronson joined the National Institutes of Health as a Senior Staff Fellow. He headed the Molecular Biology Section of the Viral Carcinogenesis Branch from 1970 until 1977, after which he became Chief of the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the National Cancer Institute, until 1993, when he was named Chairman of Oncological Sciences at The Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAaronson's early research established the transformation-competent but replication-defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned many of their oncogenes. His investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the first normal function of an oncogene and its role in growth factor signaling. His discovery of erbB2 as a v-erbB-related gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and the demonstration of its transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed against its product, and his successful isolation of KGF (FGF7), a growth factor present in the epithelialization-phase of wound healing, led to Amgen's successful phase III clinical trial and FDA approval of KGF for treatment of mucositis. Current research includes investigations into the mechanisms by which tumor suppressor genes induce permanent growth arrest/senescence, the signaling pathways involved, and investigations of the autocrine and paracrine acting growth factors PDGF, KGF, HGF, and Wnt ligands.  To date 3 papers on which Stuart Aaronson is author have been retracted, and 2 papers on which he is author have received expressions of concern.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1982\tRhoads Memorial Award\n1982\tPHS Meritorious Service Medal\n1989\tPaul Ehrlich Award\n1989\tPHS Distinguished Service Medal\n1990\tMilken Award\n1991\tChirone Prize\n1991\tHarvey Lecture\n1991\tWadsworth Memorial Foundation Award\n2005    FLC Mid-Atlantic Regional Excellence in Technology Transfer Award \u2013 Kepivance\n2006    National FLC Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer \u2013 Kepivance: Improving the Quality of Life for Cancer Patients\n\n\n== Patents ==\nPartial list:\n\n\n== Publications ==\nPartial list:\n\nAsciutti S, Akiri G, Grumolato L, Vijayakumar S, Aaronson S (2011). \"Diverse mechanisms of Wnt activation and effects of pathway inhibition on proliferation of human gastric carcinoma cells\".

Aarseth (born 1965 in Bergen, Norway) is a Norwegian academic specializing in the fields of video game studies and electronic literature. Aarseth completed his doctorate at the University of Bergen. He co-founded the Department of Humanistic Informatics at the University of Bergen, and worked there until 2003, at which time he was a full professor. He is currently a full professor and Head of Center at the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen, and principal investigator of a \u20ac2 million ERC Advanced grant for the project Making Sense of Games.Aarseth's works include groundbreaking Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature (Johns Hopkins UP 1997) book, which was originally his doctoral thesis. Cybertext focuses on mechanical organization of texts by placing the medium as a critical part of literary exchanges. The book introduces the concept of ergodic literature, which is a text that requires non-trivial effort to be traversed. The book also contains a well-known (pre-ludological) theory, \"typology of cybertext\" which allows ergodic texts to be classified by their functional qualities. (In Aarseth's later work with Solveig Smedstad & Lise Sunnan\u00e5 this typology of cybertext transforms into \"a multi-dimensional typology of games\".)Aarseth also wrote an article, \"Nonlinearity and Literary Theory\", which was published in Hyper/Text/Theory and The New Media Reader.  The article discusses the concept behind nonlinear texts, stepping away from the category of hypertext and delving into different types of media which can also be considered nonlinear.  He identifies nonlinear texts as objects of verbal communication in which the words or sequence of words may differ from reading to reading.  He also outlines the different categories and varieties of nonlinear texts. Additionally, he talks about how writing is more than just signs and symbols. Writing can be broken down into two units which are called textons and scriptons. The essay also discusses hypertext fiction in depth as well as works of interactive fiction, such as Colossal Cave Adventure, and MUDs.Aarseth is now the Editor in Chief of Game Studies, the oldest peer\nreviewed journal in the field of game studies, and member of the Advisory Board of G|A|M|E, a journal of comparative videogame analysis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGame Studies, an international journal co-founded by Aarseth\nG|A|M|E, an international journal for which Aarseth is a scientific advisor\nMaking Sense of Games - ERC project", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espen_Aarseth"}, {"title": "Sverre Aarseth", "Content": "Sverre Johannes Aarseth, (born 20 July 1934) is a research scientist at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge.

He is currently head coach of Eliteserien club Viking FK. \nHaving spent most of his playing career at Viking, Lunde Aarsheim is the player with the eighth most appearances for the club throughout history. In a playing career that lasted from 1993 to 2012, he also played for Start, Randaberg and Hundv\u00e5g, having the role of player-coach at the latter two. In 2001, he made three appearances for the Norway national team. In addition to his coaching roles at Randaberg and Hundv\u00e5g, Lunde Aarsheim has also been a coach at Sandnes Ulf and Brodd.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Viking ===\nLunde Aarsheim has spent the majority of his career at Viking FK, arriving from local club Hundv\u00e5g as a youth. Making his debut for Viking in 1994, he stayed with the club until 2005, playing a total of 425 games in all competitions, including friendly matches. A creative midfielder, Lunde Aarsheim was at his peak during the 2001 season, when he, as captain, led Viking to a league lead before suffering a serious ankle injury in a game against SK Brann halfway through the season. Although he made an extremely popular five-minute comeback in the Norwegian cup final victory over rivals Bryne FK later in the year, Lunde Aarsheim never really recovered from the injury, and his last seasons at Viking were plagued by further injuries. He only played 4 games in the 2002 season, and he was injured for parts of the 2003 season as well.\n\n\n=== Start ===\nHe remained captain of Viking until the end of the 2004 season, but midway through the 2005 season he was released on a free transfer, joining league leaders IK Start. Start finished the season in 2nd place.\n\n\n=== Randaberg ===\nIn the summer of 2007 he surprisingly joined Randaberg IL, a club playing in the 3. divisjon, the fourth tier of Norwegian football, together with \u00d8yvind Svenning. The team earned promotion to the 2. divisjon in his first season at the club. In November 2008, Lunde Aarsheim and J\u00f8rgen Tengesdal were announced as the new head coaches of Ranadaberg, with Lunde Aarsheim taking on the role of player-coach. The team earned promotion to the Norwegian First Division in the 2010 season, which was also Lunde Aarsheim's last season before he decided to retire and leave the club.After the 2010 season, he returned to his youth club Hundv\u00e5g to become a player developer.In July 2011, he came out of retirement and returned to Randaberg in the Norwegian First Division. He played eight matches during the 2011 season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe made his national team debut in a 3\u20132 win against South Korea in January 2001, earning a total of three caps for Norway. His last international match was an August 2001 friendly match against Turkey.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Hundv\u00e5g ===\nAhead of the 2012 season, he again returned to Hundv\u00e5g, becoming the head coach of the club, and also playing two matches for the club in the 4. divisjon. The team earned promotion to the 3. divisjon in his first season at the club.\n\n\n=== Sandnes Ulf ===\nOn 6 December 2013, he was appointed assistant coach of Tippeligaen club Sandnes Ulf, signing a one-year contract and becoming a part of head coach Asle Andersen's technical staff. In July 2014, Andersen got sacked, and Lunde Aarsheim served as interim head coach for one match against Molde FK. He resigned after the match.\n\n\n=== Brodd ===\nOn 30 November 2014, Lunde Aarsheim was appointed head coach of 3. divisjon club IL Brodd. He stayed at Brodd for one season.\n\n\n=== Viking ===\nIn Januar 2016, he was hired as a player developer for his former club Viking FK. Ten months later, in November 2016, he left his role as player developer to become assistant coach of the club, with Ian Burchnall becoming head coach. One year later, after the relegation of Viking to the Norwegian First Division, Burchnall was sacked, and Lunde Aarsheim led the team in the last two matches of the 2017 season. On 19 December 2017, Viking appointed Bjarne Berntsen as head coach, with Lunde Aarsheim continuing as an assistant coach. He served as an assistant coach under Berntsen for three seasons, in which the club earned promotion to the top division in 2018, and won the Norwegian Football Cup in 2019.\nOn 26 November 2020, it was announced that Bjarne Berntsen would leave Viking after the 2020 season. Simultaneously, it was announced that Lunde Aarsheim and Morten Jensen would replace Berntsen, taking over as joint head coaches on two-year contracts. Like Lunde Aarsheim, Jensen was also an assistant coach at the club before being appointed head coach. They took charge ahead of the 2021 season. Viking finished the 2021 season in third place, and on 25 March 2022, the head coaches' contracts were extended until the end of the 2025 season.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\nNotes\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of 12 July 2021\n\n\n== Honours ==\nVikingNorwegian Football Cup: 2001\n\n\n== References ==", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarte_Lunde_Aarsheim"}, {"title": "Ebba \u00c5rsj\u00f6", "Content": "Ebba \u00c5rsj\u00f6 (born 12 January 2001) is a Swedish para alpine skier who competed at the 2022 Winter Paralympics.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\u00c5rsj\u00f6 competed at the 2021 World Para Snow Sports Championships where she won gold medals in the slalom, and parallel event.She competed at the 2022 Winter Paralympics and won gold medals in the super combined and slalom standing events.

Aarsleff is a renowned specialist in the history of linguistics, the history of ideas, and the history of philosophy of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter graduation from the gymnasium with distinction in 1943, majoring in science and mathematics, he studied English language and literature at the University of Copenhagen. In 1948 he gained a scholarship for graduate study at the University of Minnesota, where he spent the next eight years until he came to Princeton in 1956. His doctoral dissertation, \u201cThe Study of Language in England, 1780\u20131860\u201d, was completed in 1960. It was published by Princeton University Press in 1967 (re-issued 1983), and soon became a classic among historians of linguistics. He was a much sought-after guest speaker at many conferences and universities in and outside the United States. He stayed at Princeton, where he rose to the rank of full professor in 1972,  for the rest of his career. He was elected to both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994.\n\n\n== Academic work ==\nRight from the start, Aarsleff\u2019s work on the history of linguistics fanned out to cover the history of ideas, the history of philosophy, and the history of science, resulting in major essays on Leibniz, Locke, Condillac, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Descartes, and Herder. In 1982, a selection of his essays was published under the title \u201cFrom Locke to Saussure: Essays in the Study of Language and Intellectual History\u201d, again a high profile publication in the field. Aarsleff also contributed a number of entries to Charles C. Gillispie\u2019s \u201cThe Dictionary of Scientific Biography\u201d, among which are major essays on John Wilkins and Thomas Sprat. In June 1991, a special conference was held in honor of Hans Aarsleff at the Sorbonne in Paris. This resulted in a festschrift \u201cLa linguistique entre mythe et histoire\u201d, edited by Daniel Droixhe and Chantal Grell (M\u00fcnster: Nodus, 1993).\nAarsleff's writings on Wilhelm von Humboldt caused controversy as they drew attention to the fact that Humboldt was heavily influenced by French philosophers and linguists, which was denied by established German scholarship. His writings on the French-Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure caused similar controversy, as he argued that Saussure\u2019s central ideas were strongly influenced by the French 19th-century philosopher-critic Hippolyte Taine, which was denied by Saussure scholars, who have shown that the ideas which Aarsleff attributes to Taine can be traced to other sources about whom Saussure himself wrote, whereas there is not a single reference to Taine in his vast writings, published and unpublished.In 1970, Aarsleff  published an article \u201cThe history of linguistics and Professor Chomsky\u201d in the high-profile linguistic periodical Language. This article drew much attention as it was an attack on Noam Chomsky's much publicized work of the preceding years in the history of linguistics, contending that it was based on deficient and partisan scholarship. Although major specialists in the field were of the same opinion, the fierce and vilifying reactions by Chomsky and his followers made Aarsleff a controversial figure among Chomskyan theoretical linguists.Among his major publications are:\n\n1967. \u201cThe Study of Language in England, 1780\u20131860.\u201d Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n1970. \u201cThe history of linguistics and Professor Chomsky.\u201d Language 46: 570\u2013585.\n1978. \u201cTaine and Saussure.\u201d The Yale Review 68: 71\u201381.\n1982. \u201cFrom Locke to Saussure.

He played state-league football with Richmond's VFL side before being drafted to the club's AFL list at the 2019 rookie draft in November 2018. Aarts made his AFL debut in round 5 of the 2020 season.\n\n\n== Early life and state-league football ==\nAarts played junior and senior local football at the Beaconsfield Football Club in his teenage years but was overlooked by junior representative TAC Cup clubs. In 2013, he followed former Beaconsfield coach Austinn Jones to the Bendigo Football Club when Jones became the club's VFL head coach. He remained with Bendigo for 32 games over two years playing as a wing and half-forward, but when the club folded at the end the 2014 season, Aarts joined the 2015 VFL-only playing squad for the AFL club Richmond's reserves team. There he played alongside the club's non-selected AFL-listed players for three years before being selected to serve in the team's leadership group for the 2018 season. Aarts finished 2018 having played 16 matches and holding averages of 13 disposals, four tackles and one goal a game, and earned an invitation to the Victorian state draft combine. By the end of the 2018 season, Aarts had played 49 matches with Richmond's reserves and a total of 81 state-league games.He attended secondary school at St. Francis Xavier College, Beaconsfield\n\n\n== AFL career ==\n\n\n=== 2019 season ===\n\nAarts was drafted by Richmond with the club's first pick and the 16th selection overall in the 2019 rookie draft.He began his first AFL-listed season by playing reserves grade practice matches with the VFL team in March 2020, including with a three-goal haul in the last of those outings. Aarts missed the opening round of the VFL season with injury but by the end of April was labelled \"ready for an AFL opportunity\" by reserves coach Craig McRae. In mid-May, Aarts was named a round 8 non-playing AFL emergency following a strong three-goal performance in the VFL a week earlier. He was rested for one VFL match later that month while dealing with general soreness and missed a further match in July with a minor calf injury. He turned in an excellent VFL performance in early August, notching 24 disposals and three goals in a showing that saw him named as an AFL emergency in round 22. While he was again an emergency in round 23, Aarts could not make an AFL debut before the beginning of the VFL finals series, where he contributed one goal in a qualifying final win over the Essendon reserves. In the preliminary final a fortnight later, Aarts was reported for rough conduct against Port Melbourne's Tom O'Sullivan and received a four-week suspension.\nDue to that suspension, Aarts was one of just six players on the Richmond list to play in neither the AFL nor VFL premiership winning sides in 2019. Aarts finished the 2019 season without having made an AFL debut, but having played 16 matches and kicking 18 goals with Richmond's reserves side in the VFL.\n\n\n=== 2020 season ===\nIn the early months of the 2019/20 pre-season, Aarts suffered from groin and hip soreness and had limited participation in training, before returning to full fitness by the first week of February 2020. He was selected to play in the opening match of the pre-season series in early-March, his first top-level game since being drafted to the club. Aarts was dropped back to reserves level after recording 10 disposals, instead playing in one VFL practice match the following week before the remainder of pre-season practice matches were cancelled due to safety concerns as a result of the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic into Australia. After just one round of AFL matches and as a result of the still unfolding pandemic, the AFL season was suspended for a period of 11 weeks. In place of the cancelled VFL season, Aarts' return to match-play came through organised reserves practice matches against opposition team's unselected players. He performed consistently well in three such matches when the season resumed in June, earning an AFL debut in round 5's win over Melbourne at the MCG. Aarts made a solid debut with 15 disposals and three score involvements in the shortened game, played with quarter lengths reduced by one fifth like all matches in that pandemic-affected 17-round season. In the week that followed, Aarts moved with the main playing group when the club was relocated to the Gold Coast in response to a virus outbreak in Melbourne. He kicked his first two career goals in his third match, a round 7 win over North Melbourne. After that breakthrough, Aarts became a regular goalkicker, contributing eight goals over the next four matches including a career-high three goals in round 9's win over the Western Bulldogs. He remained in the senior side for the rest of the regular season, including as the game's equal-leading goalscorer in a round 18 win over Adelaide despite a minor shoulder injury sustained during the match. Aarts held his place into the first week of the finals, contributing eight disposals and three tackles in a qualifying final loss to the Brisbane Lions. It was to be his last AFL match of the season however, with omitted from the semi-final side but named instead as a non-playing emergency across each of the club's final three matches including for the grand final victory over Geelong. For his debut season in which he featured in 14 of a possible 21 matches, Aarts earned equal-14th place in the club's best and fairest count.\n\n\n=== 2021 season ===\nAhead of the 2021 season, Aarts switched guernsey numbers, adopting the number 16 last worn by Shaun Hampson in 2017.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\nAarts plays as a small forward and half-forward, adept at tackling and applying defensive pressure on rebounding opposition defenders while also being relatively strong at ball-winning in contest situations compared to most small forwards. In his junior years, his time with Bendigo and his early seasons with Richmond's VFL side, Aarts played as an inside midfielder, before making a move to the forward line under the direction of Richmond VFL coach Craig McRae.\n\n\n== AFL statistics ==\nStatistics are correct to the end of round 11, 2021Notes\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrior to his professional career, Aarts worked as a qualified carpenter.Aarts and partner Amelia had a baby daughter in January 2021.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJake Aarts's profile on the official website of the Richmond Football Club\nJake Aarts's playing statistics from AFL Tables \nJake Aarts at AustralianFootball.com", "Url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Aarts"}, {"title": "Kees Aarts", "Content": "Cornelis Wilhelmus Maria Antonia (Kees) Aarts (born May 24, 1959) is a Dutch political scientist and Professor of Political Science at the Department of Public Administration (PA) of the University of Twente, particularly known for his work on comparative electoral behavior.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in 's-Hertogenbosch, Aarts studied political science at the University of Amsterdam from 1977 to 1985, and received his PhD in 1990 at the University of Twente with a thesis entitled \"Bodemverontreiniging en collectieve actie\" (Soil pollution and collective action).\nIn 1985 Aarts started as academic career as assistant professor at the University of Twente, where in 2005 he was appointed Professor of Political Science.

Aarts received a BSc degree in electrical engineering in 1977 and a PhD in physics from Delft University of Technology in 1995. He joined the Optics group at Philips Research Laboratories (formerly known as the Natlab), Eindhoven, Netherlands, in 1977. His  research initially ubvovled servo systems and signal processing for use in both Video Longplay players and compact disc players. In 1984 he joined the Acoustics Group at Philips  working on developing CAD tools and signal processing for loudspeaker systems. In 1994 he became a member of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) group at Philips   and has led projects on the improvement of sound reproduction by exploiting DSP and psychoacoustic phenomena...In 2003 he became a Philips Fellow and extended his interests in engineering to medicine and biology in particular  sensors and their signal processing for ambulatory monitoring, sleep, cardiology, perinatology, drug response monitoring (DRM) systems. and epilepsy detection. He is the author or co-author of more than 400 published papers and reports and has been credited with more than 250 patent applications, including more than 175 U.S. (more than 100 of which were granted). For his creative contributions at Philips, he received  the company's Gold Invention Award (2012)  and the Diamond Invention Award (2018) He became an IEEE Fellow  in 1997  (2007) and receiving their Chester Sall Award (2017)  and in 2010 he was awarded the AES (Audio Engineering Society's Silver Medal    He was also co-organizer and chairman of several international conventions.\nAarts has been a part-time professor at Eindhoven University of Technology(TU/e) since 2006, where he mainly supervises Master and PhD students. Since 1990 he has been president of the Aarts Consultancy. In 2019, he retired from Philips and now focuses mainly on his academic and consultancy work, the latter encompassing both technical and intellectual property (IP) advice.\n\n\n== Bass sound enhancement ==\nAarts and his collaborators at Philips  have been involved in the development, improvement and hardware implementation of bass enhancement/restoration systems exploiting the natural psycho-acoustic phenomenon known as the \"missing fundamental\".\nSmall loudspeakers are in general not capable of reproducing low frequency notes, but by exploiting auditory illusions one can use either the virtual pitch phenomenon to shift the low frequencies to a higher frequency band where the loudspeakers are capable, this is sometime referred to as Ultra Bass; or, one can map the very low frequency to one single frequency where the loudspeaker is designed for a high efficiency, this is sometime referred to as Bary Bass. On the other hand, if the loudspeaker is capable of radiating low frequencies, but if they are not present in the music, those frequencies can be derived from the music using a bandwidth extension scheme, this is sometime referred to as Infra Bass. Finally, the audio quality, especially from high Q low frequency sound transducers, can be improved by attenuating decay parts of bass signals thereby reducing sustain or ringing for bass notes, this is sometimes referred to as punchy bass \n\n\n== Publications ==\nA list of published articles (PDF) and US-patents can be found on the homepage of Ronald M.

After completing the Gymnasium-a he studied law at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. At the age of 22 van Aartsen moved to The Hague to work in politics.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nWhen Hans Wiegel became party leader, in 1971, Van Aartsen was asked to work for Wiegel as employee of the party in the House of Representatives. In 1974 he became director-general of the Telders Foundation, the scientific institute of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. Van Aartsen worked as a political consultant for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy from July 1970 until August 1974 and as the director of the Telders Foundation think tank from August 1974 until February 1979. Van Aartsen worked as a civil servant for the Ministry of the Interior from February 1979 until August 1994 as Deputy Director-General of the department for Administrative Affairs from February 1979 until April 1981 and as Director-General of the department for Administrative Affairs from April 1981 until July 1983 and as Deputy Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior from July 1983 until January 1985 and as Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior from January 1985 until August 1994.\nIn 1978 Van Aartsen became Chef de Bureau of the Secretary General of Interior.

The assailant, a 41-year-old lawyer by the name of Frederiek de Jongh and an employee of Bureau Rechtshulp in Utrecht confessed her action was politically motivated.Van Aartsen stepped down as VVD Leader in 2006; in a letter to the newly-elected party leader Mark Rutte, he however expressed his disappointment with the demise of the Second Balkenende cabinet which in his view was uncalled for. He also warned for VVD interparty warring between a populist fraction with a no-nonsense attitude and focus on tax cuts and law and order and a liberal fraction focused on personal freedoms, rule of law, international orientation and education. Jozias van Aartsen is a member of the Bilderberg Group.\nHe served as Mayor of The Hague from 2008 to 2017. He then took two acting positions: as King's Commissioner of the province of Drenthe and as Mayor of the capital Amsterdam.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVan Aartsen retired from national politics but has remained active in the public sector and continues to occupy numerous seats as a nonprofit director on several boards of directors and supervisory boards and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government.\nVan Aartsen is known for his abilities as a manager and debater.
